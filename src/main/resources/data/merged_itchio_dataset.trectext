Writing a sentence about anything, tell a story in a sentence. Ex. The knight fought and killed the evil dragon. 2. Try and make at least two links from a word or set of words in the sentence. Put a bracket where you want to link... Ex. The knight] fought and killed]]] the evil dragon]]. 3. For each new word/note again try and link at least twice. knight- a warrior] who is chivalric], brave] and rich enough]] to own and keep a mount]. Keep going with each bracket! You "Zettelkasten-ing" thinking in an index card box! Some of the commands that might help those looking for answers is: Keep in mind: I am having problems running this on a Mac, and I was wondering what the best way to contact you was? At first I was getting an error message that I did not have appropriate privileges, but I fixed that (I think). Now when I open the .command file, the terminal opens, immediately quits, and nothing happens. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks. How do I swap between pages of a given note? My text goes past the size of the textbox and purple text says PAGE 1 OF 2 but I have not found a command to get to the second page, and if it's in the tutorial videos I have missed it Love the tool nonetheless! Try the tab key. My apologies. I'm still trying to come up with a way to teach NovelBase to new users. Alas, has there been any developments in this project? None. But add me on discord @renegirard, and I'd be happy to see what I can do.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Novel Containment - A Coronavirus (COVID) Story</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS A new virus has been spreading. You are in charge of quarantine efforts at a public transit station. Examine passengers and quarantine ones displaying fever symptoms. Will you report your accurate case numbers and risk inciting public panic? Or will you under-report your numbers and risk your own life? Manage the crisis one day at a time as you try to beat the outbreak before it gets out of hand. Features: ==================== If you can, please consider donating to the game. I will be donating a portion of the proceeds to the U.N. COVID-19 solidarity fund in order to help contain this virus. Your donation will also help support the development of this and other games. https://covid19responsefund.org/ ======================== About the Creator: My name is Mike Ren, Iâm an Asian-American Game Designer currently living in Shanghai, China. This project started on January 26th, 2020 during the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. At the time, we were traveling for the Lunar New Year Festival, when we were abruptly told to return home. After returning to Shanghai, we were on lockdown from February until May, only leaving to get food and necessities. Today, things are just starting to recover here. This game is a documentary of China's response in the early days, but also a personal reflect on the crisis around the world. Although every country is reacting to the situation differently, there are many similarities and challenges we face as humans during this time. I hope that playing Novel Containment will give you a new perspective on the challenges facing us all as we continue to fight the virus in an interconnected world. Thank you!

<TEXT>A downloadable game This simple little game is just something fun to do while you read. You roll a die to randomly choose words as you read. Later you use them as a creative prompt to make some art or poetry based on what you read. Print this two-sided 2.5" by 6.5" bookmark on some card stock* and use it in your books so you can play whenever you feel like rolling some dice. You can play with a 20-sided die if you have one or a couple of 6-sided dice (those are your standard dice) if you don't. I try to make all my games accessible to screen readers .

Click download now to get access to the following files: View all posts Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Played it today, it is quite nice experience! Being diceless it means you can play it somewhere where dice would be cumbersome (or where you cannot bring them). Gameplay wise I wonder if I read the rules correctly because I end up with a lot of loot and seldom in real trouble. Mapping is always a joy and the final result looks always believable. Well done! Glad you enjoyed it! And appreciate the feedback. For gameplay you're not wrong, the adventure elements are still very rough and need a lot more attention. Been a few years since I focused on this, I think it's time to dust it off and apply a lot of what I've picked up along the way. I love this concept! Tried a mapmaking-only run just to engage and wondered if there is a creator-intended/endorsed method for dealing with total dead end situations? I pulled a title starting with a dead end and acted like I climbed in from above and took the usual 'entrance' tunnel to continue the dungeon but figured there must be a more elegant way to deal with it... This is awesome! One thing that I've noticed. In zine format it says Beta 0.6, and in the single page format it says Beta 0.4... Is this intended? Is the zine format more up to date then the single page format? Thank you, and thanks for catching that. The only difference should be the formatting, but I'll work on an update to make sure everything' s in sync and roll out 0.7! Thanks! Sounds good! I didn't do a deep comparison, but it did look like more then just formatting was different. I noticed the Monster/Treasure tables and what treasure does looked different, but that may be an error on my end. There may be more differences, because as I said I didn't go over it too deeply. Ack, thanks, definitely need to prioritize the cleanup. Had this on my "come back to" list and you've just helped bump it up! Thank you! Happy to help! Also, I went through and wrote down the differences that I noticed. What the pages format has differently from the zine format- Title page Index Example dungeon is on page 4, not at back Classes/spells Different monster table; no minotaur/cyclops in 0.6 Monster hp explanation different Actions different because of classes Pages loot table doesn't have "nothing" entries, has magic potions Different order of armour table/weapons table I think I caught all of the differences, but I may be wrong. Oh, just remembered, one key difference is there are no classes in the zine version. That was a decision for the sake of space. I did see that- might be something cool to keep for future editions, but it does take up a lot of space. honestly kind of addicting. I tend to have the end goal for my hero to âescapeâ the dungeon through an unfinished path. Already have two dungeons from this Iâm ruminating on how to reuse for other games. Ha, sounds fun, let me know if you ever share an actual play, would love to see how it works out! So! Who's running House Of Leavea using this? Love the zine! But could you add borders around the pages, for easier folding? Thank you in advance : ) Woah, so sorry I left this hanging for so long. Let me see what I can do, tho. I love this. Canât wait for the final release! Thanks, and me too! What a cute little system! Will be checking it out with my fav book Thanks and enjoy! To clarify the combat example, the vampire ("N") is defeated, so the loot is an Axe ("O") and Boots ("W")? Close - Axe (O) and Helm (W). Boots are X. Well, if I could read a lookup table, that would be a bonus. :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>In novelus the players create a novel together. It starts with a 30 minute pitch phase, during which players suggest a title, genre and short description for the upcoming sure-to-be masterpiece. Afterwards there's a 10 minute voting phase, during which the winning pitch is selected. Then the real game begins. In the writing phase a new author is picked every minute. While the chosen one writes the next passage of humanities undoubtable magnum opus the onlookers can add or remove from their writing time, depending on how pleased they are with the current writers work. You can also like passages, giving the corresponding author a higher score. A score which does essentially nothing except make this project barely passable as a game!

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows A first person adventure\quest game, where you have to look for clues and solve intricate puzzles to unlock the end of the level. Hidden throughout the house, you will find notes & journals, alluding to the dark history of the house and its owners. You're gonna take the role of a real estate agent, whose task is to investigate the house in order to find out its condition before selling, as its owners have suddenly disappeared a long time ago, preceded by tragic series of events. - Operating System: Windows 7, 8.1, 10 - Graphics card: Nvidia Geforce GT1030 | AMD Radeon RX 550 or better. Integrated graphics: RX Vega 8 (Ryzen 3 2200G\Ryzen 5 2500U or better), Intel Xe graphics. I would really appreciate if you leave your feedback about the project - which gameplay elements are done good, which are bad or neutral, your overall impression and feelings about the game. Asking for your honest opinion and help :) I'm gonna analyze those and make some decisions about the upcoming improvements and the future of the project. Bug reports and just any comments are also welcome. Thank you and have fun! Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Ok first, you spent your time clicking and clicking on everything ... (wow it's cool to click everywhere, open all the drawer for find nothing ... some much fun....) The control are weird (why not click left for use ??) I play alternating mouse/controler but no, it's not practical... The enigmas aren't really good, I finally manage to finish the game, but at what cost ? it's a good start but it's too frustrating for the moment. I hope the dev will improve the game, it as a nice atmosphere, good graphics too, and the music is great, all the ingredient are here for made a good game! Thank you for your feedback! Yes. The 1.04 patch is planned to be released next week\end of this week. Gonna contain quite a decent amount of changes including more clues. As well as some graphics improvements, better controls, level design improvements(including the mentioned empty drawers), etc. The next milestone for this version of the game(containing one location, so 1.0X) is to add a better tutorial and difficulty level selection, also rework at least one of the existing puzzles. The continuation of the story involving new location is being developed meanwhile. P.S. There is an "Pickups highlight" option available in the settings, making the game less pixel hunt. Probably a bad place for this sort of setting, should become better as I make it toggleable when starting the game. Thanks for your reply, I spent a lot of time stuck before realize there is a drawer in the desk witch contain a key, it frustrate me a lot. Good luck with your game, I'll follow the evolution, and as a amateur game developer, I know it's hard to do such thinks :) Hmm... Good point, you know. I'll see what I can do to improve it. Thanks again! The game looks incredible. The main issue I had was there are so many details and items that finding out what is actually an interactive item was overwhelming. Nothing really stood out in terms of items you could pick up. The only non-paper item I found was the lock pick It turned into an experience of clicking on everything just in case it was a usable item. I managed to get a few items but never found the a way to actually interact to solve anything (the lock pick needing something extra, trying to use a sheet of paper or the blueprint under the door didn't work). I made it as far as looking for the animal companions, so looked at several of the paintings but couldn't interact with them besides noticing the ostrich painting was in a weird location and never figured out what the animal with the crown was supposed to be. Ways to improve would be having more hints and making interactive items more prominent. A lot of escape games either have fixed scenes you move between or just less items on the stage to make the purpose clearer. That would impact the visual aspect of Novelty negatively. I would just add a more robust hint system. It does look great, though! This is a great and valuable feedback, thank you! Yes, I agree that the hints need to be improved and some sort of difficulty levels could be added to the game. I'll think about the way they could fit the game nicely. That aspect is gonna be improved with the next patch. By the way, how do you feel about the User Interface\User Experience overall? My pleasure! It's obvious a lot of work went into this game. I had no real issues with the UI/UX. I did have to drop the mouse sensitivity way down but that was an available option so it wasn't a problem. Knowing when something was interactive was the only real major complaint with the UI/UX. Having a larger cursor to know when you are mousing over sometihing interactive might be a simple fix. I did encounter some strangeness by starting a new game, going straight for the lock pick then attempting to use it upstairs in the door. After that I couldn't pick up any of the pieces of paper or take the painting off the wall. You want to add a txt walk through to this page to keep people interested. Hmm.. That's interesting, I'll check it out. Thank you for playing the game and letting me know about the issues you've had, appreciate it :) Again, you've obviously put a lot of work into this... it just needs some adjusting to appeal to someone like myself. Anything I have made comments on, take that as my own perspective. Other players might have an entirely different point of view and my suggestions would not agree with their suggestions. It's unfortunate that there isn't more feedback/comments to help with the direction you think you should take the experience. There is so much potential. Any puzzles presented so far have been a little too obtuse and confusing or lacking direction. I have a lock pick but don't know where to use it. When I have tried it on the cupboard under the stairs it does not work. When I try it on the door upstairs I am going to push the key out or something. I can turn some heads of some statues but have no idea where the clue is to solve the puzzle. There is some fake gold. I have no idea what to do with them to solve the puzzle. I can open a lot of drawers on certain sets of drawers/furniture (I think 2 pieces of furniture, 1 upstairs by the window with broken glass and one downstairs...there is nothing in those drawers), but not all drawers. That might be an asset/model thing....but it makes me go around and try and open all the drawers/cabinets on everything just in case there is something in one of those drawers. Nothing else has opened and I have at that point opened 12 drawers and haven't found anything. There is a stone on the floor upstairs that has a minor interaction but I have no idea what I am supposed to do with it...or even if I can interact with it more than looking at it and getting the information that it was thrown through the window. You have some great talent...please keep developing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows This my son and I's very first Game Jam AND first game we've been able to work on together as we're both still very very new! It's not perfect and we ran out of time and had to scrap a lot of work, but overall we learned a lot! This was a great experience and provided some forced education for sure! We're already looking forward to the next one. We both realize this isn't exactly a home run, but at least it got completed enough to submit. Thanks for putting this Game Jam on! The theme was "Out of Control" and this was our take on it given our limited skillset. We've never done this before, but it sounded like we were to zip the build produced by Unity and upload that, so that's what this is. Download the zip, extract it, and run the .exe.

<TITLE>Novel Wizard</TITLE>
<TEXT>Novel Wizard is a cleaned-up version of an unoptimized mess of an app I made years ago. I've been actively writing since 2012 and, though I no longer write epic fantasy, I do crunch a number of words into TTRPG systems and visual novels. This application is a GUI version of the process I would go through with my writing works until I built up the muscle memory to refrain from inserting certain filler words. Type Token Ratio is a value from 0-1 that is one way of ranking writing ability. It measures the frequency of unique words in a sentence. TTR is commonly rated against a single paragraph, but I formatted this program to rate an entire body of work. So, go nuts! One of the most valuable lessons I learned in writing fiction was this: If you can say the same thing with 1 word instead of 2, it's better for everyone 95% of the time. Filler words are words that fresh authors put in that often don't need to be there. Some filler words are necessary, like how sometimes the author needs to just tell the audience information instead of showing them ('show don't tell' is a good guideline for most things in writing). I found that comparing my work to authors I admire as a baseline helped me get to a similar level of filler word frequency. I'm not at their level, but it did help my writing. Paste your story in the appropriate block. You can also paste a story to compare to. The longer the text, the more accurate the numbers will be. You can also output to a CSV spreadsheet, which you can use to search for said occurrences of words and see which ones you want to delete/change in your document. BACKUP your written work, as always!

<TITLE>2D Adventure</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows I hope for 2D Adventure to be a 2D platformer, adventurous, story-line based with some puzzle aspects as well as strategy to get through certain "stages" and a few levels/areas where guns or other weapons that shoot projectiles (bows, slingshots, etc) are required so I guess it aims to be shooter as well. I hope to add some survival aspects such as surprise mini-bosses, stronger enemies as the levels progress and more This is a project I am working on in my free time and, as a solo dev, I hope to make a successful game and (hopefully) release some paid DLC's after a few years of it being on here or other websites. Also join my Discord community https://discord.gg/wPJM7k9 Step 1: Click the latest version link and download the .zip Step 2: extract the .zip into a folder named whatever you want (make sure to remember where you stored it so you can find it) Step 3: double click the .exe Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

Your only objective is to fix the robot by throwing your cog at it using the C key. Walk up to the NPC and press the X key to talk to them. Warning, the robot can walk off-screen. Also, there is no end to the game; I just quickly made this to learn certain concepts. This game is part of a game portfolio I am currently working on. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Fetch Quest 1 music pack is a collection of 10 in-game music loops. The pack contains tracks suitable for various game types like 2d adventure, rpg games. Of course the only thing thatâs stopping you using it elsewhere is your imagination. I recorded the pack in the period between August 2018 and April of 2019, 40+hours of recording and mixing the tracks. All tracks are tested in various situations like headphones, pc and tv speakers and mixed to have a good sound in all of them. Loops are also tested and work without clips and pops. Loops are also being written in a way that the player cannot easily tell when the loop starts or ends. Files are in wav format at 16 bit, 44100Hz The artwork is by ArtsyBarrels a fellow game dev from the Philippines.

I remember making Java games years ago when I was in college. Back then we were using JDK 1.1.7b. Seems like Java has come a long way over the years. Thanks. The first Java version I tried was Java 4; before that I used C++ and Pascal, but never wrote anything that couldn't be printed on a few pages. This was Java 7, the first language I got good at, thanks a lot to Minecraft.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Parabola</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS This is a small demo of a project I'm working on. You control a ball and work towards the end of the level. There are two control abilities: move and jump. Moving works as expected, but there's a little deviation in jumping from most puzzle-platformers: no mid-air control. Thank you so much for getting this far into checking out my project! A couple disclaimers: There are only five levels at the moment, and due to the fact that I'm a full time university student, there is no guarantee that this project will ever be finished. Hope you have fun! If you want to record yourself playing or giving feedback on the game, go ahead, I just would like you to send me the link or leave it down in the Feedback/Suggestion forum. Please be critical of the game, I want to know exactly how much you do or do not enjoy it. Thanks again! -Matt Click download now to get access to the following files:</TEXT>

<TITLE>Real Magic</TITLE>
<TEXT>This game was made in 72 hours for Magic Minijam 41! It's really short, and not really that much of a game per se. I used the jam opportunity to mess with an retro vibe aesthetic I've wanted to tinker with for a while, so it looks neat but the gameplay is basically non-existent in my opinion. I'm really quite proud of the aesthetic, though! All music, code and sprites made by me. Credit to Pexels and freesound.org for various royalty free assets. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.

<TITLE>The House at the end of Bleeker Street</TITLE>
<TEXT>It stood alone at the very end of the road, far past where the street had turned from the familiar black and yellow hardtop into gravely dirt. The vine-covered, wooden-paneled, slanted house stood with an alluring force that you had tried for so long to ignore. But, with your presence at its front door, you know that you have failed. You could try to convince yourself that youâre just taking a quick peek. Just a small gander at the neighborhood spook. But you know better than to kid yourself. Youâre here to finally go inside this wretched building and claim its many, many secrets as your own. The House at the end of Bleeker Street is a sprawling narrative adventure played from the perspective of a child. Throughout your journey, you will discover secrets and hints left by dozens of children who have since disappeared. These hints will guide you on your quest to find the entities responsible for the operation of The House. Occasionally, these hints will be tricks left by the malignant forces controlling the house. These tricks will mislead the player into attempting dangerous or unrelated activities in order to stop them from discovering The Houseâs secrets. This was a final project for HPU's Narrative Design Course.

The pacman-esque one I died almost immediately on the first go. Would be good to have a 3-2-1 countdown before each game starts, and maybe a word or two of instruction. Sort of like warioware.</TEXT>

Although I'd like it if you would add more challenges or quests to do to make it more engaging, and maybe also improve the animations a bit. But overall, a pretty good game! Thats a pretty nice game, I think it would be even better though if you added animations when the character walks and whatnot. Good job! intresting but you can improve the movement, good job ð So Gool good work</TEXT>

<TITLE>Zombie Thoughts - Tu cÃ¢t de raÈional gÃ¢ndeÈti?</TITLE>
<TEXT>Prezentare Joc Video: Zombie Thoughts - Tu cÃ¢t de raÈional gÃ¢ndeÈti? Introducere Ãn calitate de programator Èi psihoterapeut, am creat un joc video inovator care integreazÄ elemente de Terapie Cognitiv-ComportamentalÄ (CBT). Scopul acestui joc este de a ajuta jucÄtorii sÄ Ã®nveÈe Èi sÄ facÄ diferenÈa Ã®ntre credinÈele raÈionale Èi cele iraÈionale, contribuind astfel la Ã®mbunÄtÄÈirea sÄnÄtÄÈii mentale Èi emoÈionale. CredinÈele pe care o persoanÄ le deÈine reprezintÄ elemente cheie care contribuie decisiv la interpretarea realitÄÈii Èi a evenimentelor din viaÈa sa. DacÄ aceste credinÈe sunt absolutiste, excesive sau dogmatice, ele pot duce la reacÈii emoÈionale Èi comportamentale extreme, care pot apÄrea Ã®n situaÈii de altfel normale de viaÈÄ. Acest lucru poate conduce foarte uÈor la anxietate, depresie, episoade de furie extremÄ, dependenÈe sau tulburÄri de alimentaÈie. Descrierea Jocului Jocul este un shooter de acÈiune Ã®n care jucÄtorul trebuie sÄ elimine cÃ¢t mai mulÈi zombi. Cu toate acestea, printre zombii clasici apar Èi oameni deghizaÈi Ã®n zombi, pe care jucÄtorul trebuie sÄ-i lase Ã®n viaÈÄ. Aceste persoane deghizate pot fi recunoscute dupÄ credinÈele raÈionale afiÈate deasupra lor. Cum se JoacÄ CredinÈe RaÈionale vs. IraÈionale CredinÈe RaÈionale CredinÈele raÈionale sunt gÃ¢nduri constructive care reflectÄ realitatea Èi ajutÄ la gestionarea eficientÄ a situaÈiilor. Exemple: CredinÈe IraÈionale CredinÈele iraÈionale sunt gÃ¢nduri distorsionate care nu reflectÄ realitatea Èi pot duce la stres Èi anxietate. Exemple: Impactul CredinÈelor asupra VieÈii ImplicaÈiile Psihoterapiei CBT CBT este foarte eficientÄ Ã®n identificarea Èi schimbarea credinÈelor iraÈionale. Aceste metode ajutÄ indivizii sÄ: Concluzie Acest joc video nu este doar un mijloc de divertisment, ci Èi un instrument educaÈional valoros care promoveazÄ sÄnÄtatea mentalÄ prin Ã®nvÄÈarea diferenÈei dintre credinÈele raÈionale Èi iraÈionale. Este o modalitate interactivÄ de a Ã®nvÄÈa principiile CBT Èi RETB, contribuind astfel la dezvoltarea personalÄ Èi la o viaÈÄ mai echilibratÄ.

<TITLE>De Rei a Hyaku</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Hyaku es una joven exorcista de espÃ­ritus que llega a una casa bastante especial, pero Rei , el ente del lugar, no estÃ¡ muy contenta con la visita... Nota de los Desarrolladores: El juego fue desarrollado para la Indie Spain Jam de 2022. Actualmente el juego es completamente jugable y estÃ¡ sirviendo de prototipo para futuros desarrollos :) - AdriÃ¡n Borja : ProgramaciÃ³n. - Mireya Capitaine : DiseÃ±o UI/UX - AdriÃ¡n CortÃ©s : MÃºsica y Efectos de Sonido. - RamÃ³n Escalera : Arte 2D. - Guillermo MelÃ©ndez : PogramaciÃ³n y Arte TÃ©cnico. - Patricia Tapia : Arte 2D y Narrativa. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Sinceramente, el juego me ha parecido armÃ³nico y bello desde el momento en el que entras. Las ilustraciones son homogÃ©neas y me sorprende la cantidad de elementos con los que se puede interactuar, y sobre todo, que funcionan. SÃ­, es una jam y el tiempo es muy limitado, esto es lo que hay y se comprenden perfectamente las cosas pendientes. TambiÃ©n es cierto que no he sido capaz de identificar el tema de la jam "De 0 a 100" en De Rei a Hyaku, pero me ha gustado mucho igualmente. Â¡Muy bien chicxs! Muchas gracias por jugarlo! Es cierto que el tema anda algo escondido :) Por una parte porque no nos ha dado tiempo de implementar el final donde se ve mejor la mecÃ¡nica (el enfado del fantasma va de a 100 a medida que se van entregando los objetos errÃ³neos); por la otra parte 0 en japonÃ©s suena igual que fantasma, y el espÃ­ritu se llama 100 en japonÃ©s. Un poco rebuscado esto Ãºltimo, pero era para poder darle un toque narrativo al juego ^^ Â¡Muy bonito! logre hacer que abriera quitando el .EXE y solo colocando SGJ-2022 muchas gracias! :)</TEXT>

These digital versions are generated based on photos of the original work. Press 'R' while in the room to reload the scene and re-generate the room and work. Press 'Esc' to quit. Sandra Selig's mid-air is a site-specific installation which "comprises differently sized styrofoam balls 'beaded' intermittently on lengths of clear nylon thread.

( GOMA description ) F O R M â D E N S I T Y re-interprets mid-air by generating rooms - new sites - and installing in these sites new versions of the work, generated based on photos of the original work.

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows This game was made in 50 hours as part of the Pencil, Chisel, Code! game jam! You play as a librarian who needs to burn his beloved books to stay warm, but burning the books without reading them (in order!) makes him go insane. Survive the winter & try to stay sane while sacrificing your life's work - one small book at a time... Goal Try to stay warm by exploring the labyrinth-like abandoned library, scouring for books that haven't been damaged by the elements & can still be used to fuel the fireplace! But beware: burning books without first immortalizing their contents in your mind (in the order in which they occur in the series, you're just obsessive like that!) will lead to you slowly spiraling into insanity, so think carefully about what you sacrifice...

<TITLE>Adrian</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows This is a game about WWI, and about the people who took part in it. Meet the characters manning the trenches, and discover their personalities, their thoughts, fears and desires, behind their horizon blue uniforms. . . . . . It would require a great historian, to explain the causes of the Great War. Let it suffice to say, that Germany and Austria were allied, and at war with Russia, Great Britain, and France. All across Europe, millions of men were called to serve, and millions more volunteered out of love of country, and sense of duty. Within one month since the outbreak of war, german armies were marching through Belgium, and then onto french territory, approaching Paris. A quick victory was at Germany's hand, but such prospect was soon thwarted at the Marne, where the french and british forces made a desperate stand. Defeated, and driven off, the germans switched to the defence, retreating to an advantageous position, and digging in. A tactical stalemate ensued, and the war settled into a war of attrition. Before long, the entire frontline turned into a labyrinthian system of trenches, dugouts, and barbed wire fences. Global empires, used to the carving up of entire continents, were now fighting for the control of the most tiny strips of land. And every day, the war was taking its toll, claiming lives in the thousands. Now it's early spring, nineteen sixteen. In almost two years of war, despite frequent attempts to break the stalemate, the shape of the frontline has changed very little. What has changed much is the landscape, ravaged by constant shelling, and poisoned by the use of terrible new weapons. The sixtyfirst regiment of infantry, veteran of last year's battle of Artois, is currently manning the trenches a few miles west of Saint Magloire, in the region of Champagne. This sector of the front has kept quiet for a while. But more recently, movements of troops at the rear have caught the attention of the germans. A pomeranian division has deployed in the opposite trenches, and artillery fire has become more frequent, and intense. The telephone lines are down, knocked out by the lucky hit of a german howitzer, and until the problem is solved, communications between the regiment and headquarters have to be done via couriers. You play the part of one such courier. Your task is to deliver a dispatch to colonel Coreau, who's at the command of the regiment. It's eight in the morning, on april the sixth, nineteen sixteen, and the colonel is waiting for you in the trenches. . . . . . This is a game about war, but not about combat. You won't find waves upon waves of enemies, only waves upon waves of text. For those who are into history, visual novels, and walking simulators. Headphones, a dark room, and about an hour of spare time are recommended. The game lacks a saving system. After the game ends, more content becomes accessible by clicking the extras button in the main menu. The game has been notably improved by updates. All releases are standalone, and the current version is 1.5. If the game doesn't work on your machine, or if you find a typo or a bug, please leave a comment or contact the developer. Per gli italiani la fuori, navigatori intraprendenti nelle acque tempestose della rete, raccomando di giocare Adrian nella lingua madre dello sviluppatore.

Full gameplay of that great visual novel: 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHz92TDcaYY 2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60GOXjnz68Y This is helpful, thanks. And thanks for playing. Really interesting little game. I still couldn't finish it, but it often comes into my mind - mostly because I can hardly wait to see how the updated version will turn out. I wonder which aspects you're planning to change or improve. Keep it up! :) Really great, different war game! The visual style with the slight fog and the good story go together really well. It's a bit like reading an interactive book. We'd be happy to see this game in our this year's Game Development World Championship! In my usual game search, I came across the symbolic barbed wire Adrian. This was an amazingly intense narrative despite the brief silences between artillery shelling. That silence amplified the immersion and made me dwell on the Grimm, Dark power of war this expresses. I have to say I was surprised by what this game entailed for me, looking at the character models, I was expecting perhaps a small combat sequence (contrary to the description), but the result was a rather wonderfully dark experience as an observer. This is a wonderful experience despite the downside of it all resulting in such great losses. I hope to revisit this again just to gain new perspective on all the stories. Happy Memorial Day to all!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Adrian Was Left Behind - Matt Aspland Game Jam</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Adrian was left behind is a 2D puzzle platformer about a boy who was kidnapped by a company. Play as a boy and communicate with Adrian, another person who was kidnapped by the company and find a way to escape... All programming was made by me. Most art was made by me with the exception of a few made by Kenney Assets - https://kenney.nl/assets The menu and game soundtracks were made by me. But the last soundtrack (my favourite) was made by my good friend Nyk Verse - Unzip, open the folder and double-click the Application file. Enjoy! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Thanks! Sorry for the late reply but I appreciate you playing the game :D Everyone keeps asking me haha, basically the story is based around a company that is called "Celebration Services" and they are trying to brainwash you into working for them in a facility where they make things for celebrations. Sorry if it wasn't clear in the game.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Adrian's Adventure</TITLE>
<TEXT>A quick, simple and easy game about sustainability, electric busses, the Eiffel Tower, and climate change. Also, this game isn't very good, but yeah. It uses a lot of assets from the itch.io game assets section, but I'm too lazy to list them all. So yeah, maybe you'll enjoy this. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. This game holds a deep and introspective view on the problems faced by our society today. Adrian serves as an innovator, and a person who's deepest desire is to help save humanity, whereas each individual level brings it's own challenge he has to overcome. The first stage represents him finding his footwork, and entering the game we call life. The second level shows that, through trials and tribulations, one may reap a reward, and the final stage shows the true strength of the indominable human spirit. Though these levels may attempt to thwart our hero, he remains strong, and successfully completes each level. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and will be on the lookout for more from this "cyberpxl" character. I can confirm, I highly agree with you, it's simple exterior is made to hold something far deeper and more complex within, than what originally meets the eye. You seem to be a very introspective person such as myself, and I believe this 'cyberpixel' fellow is to! I also look forward to more amazing, deep, nuanced, subtle, yet EXPLOSIVE media! also I wholeheartedly believe this game is unbeatable, but I just know there will be more flavourful instillations to come! I cannot wait! I FUCKING LOVE THISS QUHXOI`2JPORK rel i can conclude. it twas a game. the best of games i havent played it yet, but banger game nonetheless</TEXT>

I'm on Mac and it's just a much nicer UX working with those. Certainly one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time. I can't quite describe why, apart that it remind me of Sim City 2000's.

Would you consider donating Mac Steam keys so that no one can freely distribute your game? If that doesn't work for you either, I understand. most intelligent scammer i was so confused until i saw this excuse me, could you tell me if I buy this music can I use it on my videogame creation? or its just for listening purposes? What do you think? You can't use someone else's music just because you buy it woo take it easy dude, is a question you need some calming pills You're allowed to use it for anything after purchase as long as it is only visible to you and you do not make any profit off of it. I was wondering: are there plans to release the new tracks that were added in the level editor update? Yup! Once the editor is officially out :) Thank you! I love the new tracks! I did notice, though, that the "tinker" music is still missing—was that intentional? Hi, I'm a teacher who would like to use Baba in schools and help promote it in NYC.

Lmaooooo I messed up real bad and now baba is jump Still annoyingly cute though, I'll give him that BABA IS UNCONTROLLABLY BOUNCING SEND HELP HE IS ALSO SOMEHOW VERY VERY TINY SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH HIM MY BELOVED SON PLEASE STOP (I love him so much go little baby Baba go) how does this work Baba is friend i had an eyeless baba glitch for a while, i don't know how it happened but today my pc turned off and now eyeless baba is gone pls fix the bug for windows 11 os cuz i cannot open the exe file +compatibility mode dosent help tooð­ Do you get nothing except for that error when you try to run the game? Where is the program folder located? Could you test placing the Baba Friend folder (with all its contents) on your desktop and running the program from there, in case it's an issue with Windows denying reading access to the game files? i dragged it to desktop but it still not works (i dragged the folder and the files) maybe this error caused cuz my os is russian, i mean some apps don't support russian symbols, btw i moved the folder to windows C: and it worked, but this time baba just was levitating, and then it fell to nowhere Righto, sounds like it was a reading issue. Does Baba still not move if you for example open a text editor or some program where the background is just one colour? Can you drag Baba around? only after i drag baba around he moves, but he just falls in nowhere, maybe its bcuz i have a seelen ui thingy and ur program doesn't see this task bar, and also i noticed that baba is really smal (i cant show the screenshot cuz i deleted the baba friend) +he's reeeeally slow when he falls (idk if its not a bug) Baba is fast Probably frame rate issue, but maybe somebody know how to lower its speed? Baba moved from desktop to laptop and now is quick Reading "Baba is fast" was funnier than it should have been... Funny thing: my baba keeps hanging out in the bottom right of my screen when that's the corner (along with top right) that's broken. is this a shimeji? nvm it looks like its own thing why does my baba lose his eyes and i cant throw baba around anymore :( (when he loses his eyes) he is so cute so tiny cute baby lil baby woo baby white snow leg baby bb baba baby bay bay baybay baybee baybe bebe caca beybey lul ur cute Hello Hempuli, I dont know if ur still reading comments on this little game u made, but if so it would be nice of you to answer a small question of mine. You see, the last week or so iÂ´ve been making a few new sprites for baba (a slime, cause they are cute!) and iÂ´ve run into the problem that i have no idea how to add frames to the animations. I did search online, but nothing came up. Your help would be greatly appreciated, or anyones help honestly. thanks if anyone even reads this. Siris Sadly, the animations are limited to exactly the amount of frames Baba & Keke have due to the way the program Baba Friend was made with handles sprites :( i see, thanks for telling me! and so quickly!! Btw, if u would like to see the sprites iÂ´d be happy to give them to you. But i havent done this too often, so dont expect too much Baba is Friend and Cool I can't pet it? Can I have help? Just move from top to bottom several times that happens. make linux plssssssssssss I made a silly little guy. You can download him here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H107quSBOYThKAcOE2eVerTHPyEchib5/view?usp=shari... He is silly. Good boy little silly guy. Thanks! BABA IS FRIEND make mac version pleaaase!!!! How to he remove on desktop? love this, even though running this via WINE causes the sprites to be all-blackâ¦ would a native linux version be possible? what a silly fellow it keeps giving me this error message whenever i try to open babafriend: Cannot load kcmouse.mfx This object might need an external program or library not yet installed. i love it i don't remember why i got baba or how long i've had baba, but i have them on my computer and i absolutely love them! baba is friend! <3 as a proud baba owner of half a year, i can confirm that baba is in fact, a friend same BABA IS BEST BONZI NOT WITHOUT BABA IS DONE KINITO NOT WITHOUT BABA IS DONE BABA IS ALL ALL IS BABA BABA IS WIN COMMENT IS BASED kinito is bonus how to use keke?? i seen him but can't spawn him?? right click baba, click "open setup.exe" change sprite_folder=baba to sprite_folder=keke and then open the app again I can't download it :( What kind of an error do you get? how do i get keke guys its virus XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD No, it's not. pants on fire ima mess with his settings i have some questions 1. how to pet baba 2. why cant i find the settings when i right click him? baba is skrunkly move your mouse on baba. right click better- you can use your own sprites. baba is skrunkly and derp can we name it yea... baba suggestion: would love it if baba could talk! like just a tiny baba saying stuff like "make sure to hydrate and finish youe tasks" would be really awesome :) although it would be even MORE awesome if the user could edit the text baba says; making mini to do lists or reminders would be fun works under wine on linux - and the friend gets a little shadow on cinnamon, too :) having a small issue, though: baba keeps getting stuck in one spot near the bottom-right corner. when dragging baba around, it seems the invisible window isnât quite the size of my monitor, but the internal coordinates go further. this is as far as the friend will go: You could change your wallpaper to have walls where Baba won't go, and include the rule "WALL IS STOP" that's genius virus or no virus no virus thx Is there a way to make baba less hyperactive? :o There's a settings menu to change it</TEXT>

Excellent dedication to the theme, thank you i love how this game's smaller than 3 minutes of a spotify song ÙÙ ØªØ¹Ù Ù Ø¹ÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙÙØ¯Ø§Ù Ø² 7 No, but I use a plug-in that makes the taskbar look like Windows 7 I use a program called Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and its older versions. It's an old program not often used anymore and has a lot of little problems but I'm used to it. has anyone gotten the max score on the multiple choice answers? it seems like you could at least brute force that it you marked the boxes in the right way. A game where the idea is to fill out taxes sounds extremely strange but I can't stop thinking about Baba's face full of stress when faced with something that many people really don't know how to deal with and for which many turn to accountants to take care of it. your taxes. At least I don't feel that the game clearly indicates what it wants from you, but in the end the game qualifies how much you pay attention to the shapes of the document but mainly how much the signatures resemble Baba's, something curious about that is that of course Yes, making many signatures in a row is tiring and it is normal that the form of the signature is not always the same, but trying to duplicate a signature instead of your own makes things more difficult. Curious game that parodies how frustrating it is to do government procedures, but it is fine as a small but certainly original experience accurate simulation of filing your bloody taxes the game described in 3 words: baba files taxes (the same as the title) Mildly addictive good stuff! who are you I think it normally would show what the signature looks like under your face-cam. I like this silly game. one of the games ever ? I didn't even know this was official when I saw Icely play it... Even BaBa has to do taxes and i have learned i am scared to do taxes, not much feedback i can really give but thanks for the fun little game Amazing! Why is this so FUN? jesus, now i know how taxes are boring and scary, my highscore is 127 what about the uncombined scores? i want to switch existence with baba I've commited tax fraud and have no regrets. Your game starts at 2:57 kinda thought this was a fangame lol I did my best to hel, though I fear I may have cause more harm than good...I'm not that great at taxes either... at least a free game by hempuli 11/10, good gameplay, had a good laugh ;D this game made me happy thank you lol, this game is so silly, my assignature doenst really matches baba's lmao Finally, a game that will teach me something that school didn't; and I get to help somebody! Linux version? https://www.winehq.org just use that Wine generally has mixed compatibility with itch.io games. Depending on what engine/framework the game was created in, it might be easier for the creator to make a Linux download available. ah, I didn't know that. I only used it with like one or two games, and it worked fine for me then As someone who prepares taxes professionally, this is an amazing and accurate game. Wonderfully done! i'll download this just so i can commit tax fraud Lol This was possibly the most accurate tax-game available. Yeah hi the game was simple and fun ,great work i made new game (bvb-guess ) too if want check my game and tell any bug or new things that i can add to it ,thank you a sweet friend in need, how could I refuse? Yeah true :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Babataire</TITLE>
<TEXT>A solitaire inspired heavily by Zachtronics' Cluj solitaire, with Baba Is You character art on the cards! How to play: - Use left mouse to move cards around - Use right mouse to place cards sideways - Click on the "Display rules" checkbox to see the rules description Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. after like 70 attempts I won :D Try to get more than two cards outside of the screen. (My record) How can I make the wins counter get higher than 1? It works for me on Firefox, but not when I used Chrome. I play this so much. I previously got addicted to solitaire (boomer activity I know), this version is so much better. Thanks for giving me something to do at work! Found this six months ago and its been my go to computer past time for the entirety of those six months, very challenging and fun. Love to have a downloadable version if that is still in the cards (no pun intended) :3 I FINALLY BEAT IT LET'S GO! Congrats! Five cards completely out of screen. Personal record :) I feel like this is the hardest version of solitaire I've ever seen, while normal solitaire is solvable 80% of the time, I feel like this might only be solvable 30% of the time. I've always wondered whether they're all solvable or not. I do believe my solve rate is higher than 30%. Maybe not 80% though, but I do beat more than 1 in 2, so around 60% I guess? That doesn't mean the ones I fail at were not solvable though, there's unrecoverable mistakes for sure. it's probably intended as part of the game but I would love it if cards dont automatically get "sent up" -- i still need that card to place another low number card from another suite :( I actually like how challenging it is. There are two bugs though. One I'm not sure really how to describe. Sometimes, seemingly randomly, when you pick up a card and place it back at the same spot, it phases through the card it's supposed to sit on, which makes it no longer interactable with. Undoing doesn't fix it, since it doesn't count as a new action. Unfortunately this usually completely ruins the current round. The other, as others have mentioned, is that the win counter always resets. Would be great if fixed, thanks! Another request is to be able to undo multiple times, or have the ability to restart the same seed. I've seen that bug too. Luckily it doesn't happen to me very often. Same seed, yessss, I'd love that. Multiple undo's feels like easy mode, so I guess ok from an accessibility perspective, but I have to admit I do like the challenge without that. There are some plays where you're like "argh, why did I just do this instead of that" and you just can't undo it, but oh well :shrug: hahaha though it probably wont be fixed, i would like to see a sideways card be able to be placed somewhere else as a sideways card I think that might make the game too easy; it'd change the way you can move the cards quite a bit. I'd love to download this for my offline netbook but it seems not possible A downloadable version will be coming eventually You made my day! Any added features? Will it work on phones? unfortunately the only way to play again after a win is the reset button.... I looove this game. I've had a tab with Babataire open for months, and it's an amazing quick way to decompress from work before I start something new. I love the design. Went on to get the Zachtronics Solitaire collection and Cluj is nice, but I really love the twist hempuli did here. And I tried the EX version - very Babatastic but still prefer this clean design. I'd love it if the win rate was tracked, win counter resets when you deal again too. Oh, and is every game solvable? A full release is highly encouraged, as an app or whatever, and features like going back to a specific seed would be ace. This is so much fun, and it's well made! I never had the chance to try Cluj out before, so this cute deck was my gateway in. I gotta say, once I learned the rules I got obsessed. I'm up to 10 wins, and I can't seem to tear myself away from playing this at least twice every day. Cute deck, works well, very fun! On windows background cards are a little to hard to distinguish. If a little more of the card could be seen it would help a lot. it would be nice if there was a toggle for whether the cards discarded automatically or not. not only would non-automatic discarding make the game slightly easier but also i want to line all the cards up I've spent more hours that I would admit. When you understand the rules is quite fun. There is a bug that swaps the last two cards when there are a lot of cards in a row, but it's definitely playable i wanna download I may have taken around an hour to actually win a game and understanding the game better, but boy how I loved it! hint: if you are having some difficulty, you can put a sideways white 7 card, for example, atop of an 8 white card. if you already have a group of same color cards, this can make it easier to stack other colored cards if there isn't any space Some bug with stack 4. For some reason the "red 2" card automatically moved up despite it was lowest card in the stack (undo button shown the animation how it goes back, but then it again automatically goes to the top, so in fact nothing is "undone") https://ibb.co/f19xyv1 I ended up in this unwinnable situation: https://ibb.co/4d8pphV PS: the bug happened only once, the game is amazing (I didn't think a solitaire game could be so interesting to me) Thanks for the compliment! I've been thinking of adding a "Stack" button like in Babataire EX in part to fix this issue, because the problem is somehow related to the auto-stacking being too "fast". Ran into a bug in 1.0.6 where the game auto-placed the Baba "Ace" card even though there was still a green 5 covering it. This resulted in a situation where it seemed to be ignoring that card when trying to play other cards upon it. Thanks! Ugh, I thought I had fixed this issue... I really like the concept, I just have trouble reading the half-numbers. Idk how hard it would be from a programming perspective to do those 'peek at this card' options a lot of solitaire games have, but if that's too hard, making the numbers a bit easier to read or making the cards stack a bit differently would really help! Regardless, thanks for the game :D Hmm, I think I could try a peeking functionality! A little bit of ambiguity in the rule description messed me up. When it says "Up to 2 cards can be placed sideways onto any other card," It doesn't mean up to two cards can be placed sideways onto a single other card as many times as the player likes, instead it means, up to two single cards can individually be played onto non-sideways cards over the whole board at once. I was wondering why sometimes the game wouldn't let me place a sideways card until I parsed it correctly. Thanks! Trying to word these kinds of rules in a succinct way without there being ambiguity is tough; I'll adjust the wording a bit. As someone who shuffles words around a lot (and I'm not talking in a Baba Is You sense, heh), I am sympathetic. Very cool! One note: After a certain number of restarts (around six or seven), the restart button stops working. There's a bug where the keyboard inputs stop working if you click outside the game area; I suspect that's in play here. No idea what causes that though :( Oh yeah, I think that's what's happening. My bad for not thinking of that (^_^'') Suggestion: Add an undo for minor mistakes That'd be nice, yeah Insane how you guys are suddenly releasing games rapidly, very cool. (Also, IDK if this is possible to implement, but a level builder in The Plumber Thing would be really cool to see) Hempuli, make more of these "Baba" Themed games! And, I know you live in the same country as me! it reminds me of spider solitaire, combined with an odd and exciting version of free cell where the free cells are the cards themselvesâ¦ seems difficult so far! Iâve managed to win once out of ~fifteen games, but I canât really tell you what went right that run. Iâve played a ton of free cell but I was never any good at spider solitaire. I find it a bit strange that if I put a 3 sideways onto a 4, Iâm not allowed to pick up the sideways 3 and re-place it rightsideup on the 4 (and this can be useful sometimes to give myself a free cell) Iâm also surprised that cards auto-score as soon as they possibly can â sometimes it would be helpful if they stayed in place until there were no lower cards of any suit. But I havenât played much of this game yet and so I hesitate to suggest changing it, maybe it adds an interesting wrinkle where I should try to build multi-color stacks instead of single-color stacks, to prevent this great game! looking forward to playing a lot more of this There might be a bug there. I've definitely put a sideways card on the next higher card and then "untapped" it without any issues. I agree that cards scoring automatically feels like that could soft-lock you; both games I won I was in a situation were a card I wanted to use would instead auto-score itself. I found other ways to work without those, but yeah, scoring feels more risky than expected. The mouse randomly stops responding Did you move the mouse outside the game window when this happened? Could you try clicking the game window the next time it happens and see if that helps? I tried clicking inside, clicking outside, and dragging from one to the other, but none of it seemed to help :( Same issue. The very first time, I could see the game completely froze since the card distribution stopped right in the middle (a certain random seed must cause a bad distribution, maybe if you run 1000 automated tests with different random seeds / predefined distributions youâll get it?). The other times, the input stopped responding, possibly due to a game freeze too (itâs hard to say because there are no animated elements on the screen to tell if everything stopped moving). EDIT: wait, Voltt found a 100% repro, see below. Would be nice to have an "undo" button; it's very easy to misclick in a way that gets the game into an unsolvable state. Yeah, I think I'll add a limited undo to this I love the fact this made me go "I'm gonna Towers of Hannoi this shit" accidentally dragging a card off screen causes it to freeze Only for the duration the mouse is off-screen, though? I was able to freeze it proper. I think the same thing happens when you click into another tab and then return to the game though? Might be related. Hmm, interesting; so far I've only managed to make the game temporarily freeze (with a click on the game window unfreezing). I 100% wouldn't be surprised of an actual freeze/crash existing, mind you, haha Reproduced 100% on itch.io page under Chrome. Click on card, then click outside embedded window. Clicking inside does not unfreeze. Ah, thanks for the reproduction steps! Got it to happen now. Hopefully something can be done about this. I am not entirely sure what I did, but it froze for me as well. same; I can consistently break the game by clicking outside of the iframe while the cards are being dealt at the start. (at anytime actually, but it noticeably pauses the card-deal animation) The game permanently freezes and I need to refresh the page</TEXT>

<TITLE>Babataire EX</TITLE>
<TEXT>Another solitaire, this time with actual Baba Is You mechanics! Stack all suits in order from 1 to 10, and form rules to help you on your way! How to play: - Use left mouse to move cards around - Click on the "Display rules" checkbox to see the rules description Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. got unlucky. I just finished this game without using the rules I have officially beaten it, this took me less time than the original Babataire but was way more fun in my opinion. ...Gosh darn it... I feel like this would be better if text cards always stacked onto each other. It wouldn't matter if they're different types (name, "is", property) or if it helps form a statement; You'd always be able to stack the cards. I also feel like it would be nice if the rule cards had their own border colour; Maybe pink, like the "text" noun, while the current border for a value being changed becomes purple instead. I competed babataire without any rule cards being used. Ran into a controls issue. Managed to stack so many cards in one pile that the movable part was offscreen. Even though the rules would allow continued play, my cursor can't reach the playable cards. dear god beat it how do i screenshot took me a while, but i managed to solve a deck. this is amazing Sorry, but I have no idea how quality cards are supposed to work, and what the win should look like. What's a stack? I'll never know that either. Bye everyone, english instructions are hard. Cool twist! Though the Restart button seems to reset my score to 0 as well? This makes me feel so smart and so dumb at the same time. 11/10 Realizing now that you can get yourself stuck because "+5" and "OPPOSITE" can't be applied to the same suit. Bummer cause it feels kind of bad and hard to plan for (and disincentivizes getting creative with rules). If I could do "FOFO IS KEKE IS OPPOSITE *AND* +5" it could work, but I imagine "AND" would be hard to add as a separate card (what would "BABA IS KEKE AND FOFO" do lol). Maybe just code in that if "OPPOSITE" and "+5" are stacked it reads as "OPPOSITE AND +5"? Maybe that would be too strong in the early game. baba is keke and fofo makes baba cards work as keke and fofo card i wanna download can't stop playing. nice work Pretty cool game! One thing is that the fifth pile on the left feels a bit hard to notice as well as the whelmings of rules making it easy to get stuck, but I guess it's also easy to stuck in regular solitaire think a discard pile for rules would be nice, really sucks loosing so much space for the extra is s and words Baba Is Confused I think the game would really benefit from an undo button. is this unwinnable? really needs a tutorial Agreed that the game'd really benefit from a tutorial; for that particular setup, you could move K10 to a middle slot, the the K2 onto the top slot, then keep putting cards onto the middle slots until you dug out the first Is, which'd let you free up some of the middle slots by forming rules. wait how would you dig out an is if all the middle slots are filled??? and even then there isn't space to make a rule other slots I got about 10 cards from the end, when I realised I had made an unsolvable situation. I was still able to whittle it down to 5 cards, but I wasn't even able to make a 9 anymore at the end, regardless of which suit it was. So not sure how that's possible, but it happened :b Using the rules in certain combinations can cause those situations, yeah Did you try stacking effects? I think once you get to an end board they are all solvable. I tried all sorts of stuff, was over a month ago but I think this was a screenshot from the situation. make BABA is KEKE and then hit stack, you should be able to finish the rest yourself I retried something as 10 times before understanding the way it behaves (tenacious because I was really hooked by the concept ^^). Perhaps a highlight on the places a card can go (when you hover it) could help? I sadly miss-clicked on Restart while wanted to check "Display rules".... while I almost finished the game :/ A popup "Sure?" could handle that ? I think I'll make it so that you need to hold the button down for a bit before it takes effect. Thanks for the feedback! I'll consider the highlighting (it's potentially a bit of an ordeal to implement with how the rest of the engine is done, sadly). I think it would just make a lot of sense if the âRestartâ and âStackâ buttons just changed places, with restart under the score, which you never need to click. Fair point! I nearly lost my streak going to click where Stack used to be after updating. Noticed just in time. I knew that switching the locations would cause some confusion, but my hope was that it'd still be overall better in the long run. Lovely concept, however the realization that "ON ANY" is pretty much the only rule that is required to beat the game shrinks down the excitement from solving this otherwise neat puzzle. It was cool to tryhard without it, but once the realization came, every other rule had become useless and the solution was just a matter of time and clicks. Dk what to do with this(maybe restrict the rule rearrangement), but imo this rule is too good that it ruins the game for me, that otherwise would have been very replayable. Thanks for the feedback! I tried to adjust that rule slightly more to improve the balance even further. This is really cool :D Thought I was almost done and then I was here :/ Neatly solvable situation, no? This was fantastic. I had to loose 4 or 5 games before I understood, but it was fun! "is any #" was essential. I had 3 suit names available and was able to juggle. Really well done! This was a very delightful mess! It's really fun, especially when you line up a [Suit is Any#] rule. I did notice that the Wins counter resets when you press Restart which is a bit odd I think this is an engine thing, maybe? I noticed that Babataire and Cavern Sweeper both had this bug Small bug: - you can stack a suit card on IS in the middle slots (ex. IS BABA), but if you pick up the stack you canât put it back down (unless, presumably, there's another suit card available to stack onto). On the other hand, you canât stack a quality on âISâ at all unless thereâs already a suit card below âISâ. I really struggled with the rules in this one: - the second rule says that the middle 4 slots can be used to hold only 1 card, but then later itâs said that rules can be stacked on the middle 4 slots, so really itâs âthe middle 4 slots can only be used to hold one regular 1-10 card, or up to three face cards if theyâre stacked as if in a ruleâ. Because you can stack them sometimes, I tried to stack regular cards on there multiple times before realizing it just doesnât work that way - When I read âface cardâ I think of the face cards in normal cards, which are just regular cards with high value. I assumed the B, K, F, J cards were the suit cards at first (this would probably be easier to understand if Iâd played the original babataire) and got pretty confused. I think itâd be easier for me to understand if they were called ârule cardsâ. - the fact that the colors of the âany suit,â âoppositeâ and âany #â cards match the suit cards made me feel they were part of the same suit in some way but that doesnât appear to be the case Thanks for the reports! I gave this a proper read and will adjust the rules text a bit based on your feedback & fixed the bug :) managed to finish a game with the new changes! the rules are very satisfying to work with insane how you post this after i beat babataire after days of attempts good game</TEXT>

Preferably one that isn't read-only although that shouldn't matter. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. it seems to look like a puzzle NES-game i love this gamea I'm not sure where else to put this, but someone apparently stole/ripped off your game. Link: https://tallercreacionvideojuegos.itch.io/baba-is-you ive never fucking expected that uhm. just saying the game credits this one ItÂ´s a school for videogames creation. Yeah, this seems to be someone trying to recreate BiY to learn, and to have fun. They also credit the original designer. Game is fun Fun make rate Rate is 10 Baba love game the beginning of a beautiful game. baba is me me is happy happy is rate rate is 10 10 is out out is of of is 100 What are these cursed comments? Comment Is Cursed Baba Is Laugh TheCoolManOfEpicness Is Rate Rate Is 10 Amazing game, Really wish there was a longer and more polished version though.. hmmmm i wonderrrrr ...This is just a copy of the original Baba is You. Atleast MENTION it's a copy or fangame or something This is actually the original version before the game was developed and released as a proper game. Oh, cool! its made by the same person who made biy though hmm baba is classic The base structure is similar to other puzzle games where you push and move things to reach the goal, but an important difference with respect to other games is that the rules of the level itself are included in the scenario as objects within it that can be pushed and changed at the convenience of the player. This gives a very curious feeling of feeling smarter than the game because of that feeling of breaking or changing rules, but it really is a fairly open system that allows you to pass levels in different ways. Games made in game jams are usually small due to the fact that you have a tiny amount of time to develop a game from scratch (usually 2 to 7 days) but sometimes quite original ideas come out like this title that turned a small prototype in an award winning in its complete version of 2019. Is there a difference between the zip builds? On the surface it seems not. They both seem functionally the same. He might have polished it a bit more or fixed something but it seems identical. How to customize baba is you jam build? There is a secret level editor here, all you need to do is press the \ button. yo, hempuli not sure if you'll see this but could you put slip into the level editor, many thanks. There is a secret level editor, actually. Hempuli has instructions on how to use it in the description. i love this game, i give it 999999/10 i will be getting the full game, absolute brain teaser, the dev did so well, there are no bugs (that I've found) this game is awesome, i'm surprised that this was a game jam for how impressive the puzzles are. baba is you in jam build does not work in windows 10 right, well i run on 8.1 it does hi hi hi (Let's start a chain) hi I used a windows 10 pc and it worked completely fine This is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played, and it is a jam game!? Congratulations! I am incredibly jealous of your talent! If you haven't played it yet, check out the full game! Soooo much bigger, absolutely crazy puzzles too! Not to mention that the level editor is now public to everyone. If you didn't have access to the beta, now you do! Did you know KILL was renamed to DEFEAT after the full game yes I always read DEFEAT as DEATH Please add Linux support :) yes its not give me to download, its saying : cnot open executable file you have to extract the file firs its sad that there is none for Mac users :( The new full version does, it costs about Â£10 though. I met the creator of the game :D Ye u met hemp In the first level i made it so that rock is win on accident when i figured out i could change rules. So then in the "Wall is stop" Level i made myself the wall me too lol plz give me .mfa so i have download baba is you and when i go to open it, it give me a black screen with green edges and does nothing... help make sure the path to the game doesnt have any bad symbols, like cyrrilic Oh hey look, it's blokos! gra pe fan :) Baba love grape too :) Deleted post i have made a mod on itch of this version. rebateman is low on ideas rebateman needs help here is mod plz help Game Is Amazing Brain Is Hurting (Really good work!!) FranzDaMLG is stuck FranzDaMLG is Bamboozle FranzDaMLG is Quit Movement was a bit laggy, but nice game overall. You've definitely made a lot of improvements in the full version. How do u use the level editor? Key Right To The"Enter" Key IS Editor i tried to press enter but it didnt work and another enter either! Game Is Awesome Fullversion Is Expensive Harry Is Broke Harry Is Sad Guest1 is smart Pirated version is free pirated version doesn't reward the developers for their hard work. Guest1 is thief identical copies of digital goods takes no work or time. stealing of digital goods is a logical fallacy. amplified 1 should think about "No DRM". are you saying that a developer should only be able to sell one copy? should films only have to sell one ticket? Think of it as a tip, then, or even a suggested donation when entering a museum or gallery. Maybe it's not literally stealing to opt out of the agreed-upon price, but it's still a dick move. Unless you want to become an old-school patron and pay devs a salary with room and board out of your own pocket in exchange for games that you freely share with everyone. Because that's the alternative to players sharing the cost of the work and time. Pirate is smart Everyone is pirate Dev is broke Dev is sad Game is Pirate is problem Mistake Is Guest1, Pirate Is Bad, Guest1 Is Regret Guest1 is pirate Guest1 is not pay People seeing Guest1 follow Guest1 People is not pay Hempuli has not money Hempuli make not game Game is not more Game not without pirate is not more please help i have black screen when i run the game pls help Are you on Windows 10? yes i am on windows 10 Could you contact me at the e-mail address found on this page: http://www.hempuli.com/press/sheet.php?p=Baba_Is_You ? Don't extract (When you extrakt the level-data is gone) same here and i dont know how to fix it Where did you extract the game zip? Or are you playing the game straight from the zip file? What sort of Windows 10 computer can't handle a 2D game? It even works on Windows XP ! An Excelent Game, there were moments when I really said "Aha" and felt incredible. Thanks! Aha moments are great, but this game also has some of the elusive "wait, but if I instead..." moments. question, I have the new retail release. I have yet to try this but are the levels different? Is the game different? Thanks in advance for all your hard work! Most of the levels in the jam version are in the final game; some of the rule logic is different and/or more buggy in the jam version. Thank you! Question: Its just a black screen. How do i play the game? There should be a title screen when you start. Make sure the game isn't in a folder that doesn't have reading permission; other than that, I might not be able to help much :( Masterpiece, brillant game... When i get the money i will buy this without doubt! I "bought" (donated) to get this game here on itch.io, and I totally loved it. Could I please get a redeemable code to download the version that's on the Steam store? My username here is jobury and my username on Steam is neoaxelfire thats not how buying things works Well, see the thing is, you don't need to donate for this one. It's free. It's a nice thing to do but not required. Also, unless you donated like $20 it's not enough to pay for full. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Baba Altama - 1st Stitch is an RPG platformer about an old lady who can make magical crochets. She must travel the world destroying part of her work that became mad (the evil crochets) and fixing their destruction. This is a prototype version. If you enjoyed the game, let me know! Maybe I consider working on a full version. PS: There's some bugs since this was created with a much older Construct 2 version and re-exported. I will fix it as soon as I can. For more games please visit: https://www.indigoarts.net Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Did you ever do more with this idea? Super cute. Thank you! Not really :(. I thought in doing a metroidvania for the full version. but as the game did not get enough attention I thought people would not be interested. Who knows in the future? Besides that, I have a game called Heart of Smoke that works as a soft spin off (the main character is the husband of Baba Altama). this is soooooooooo cute i love it so much :) Thanks so much!

Basic Ruleset implemented: Transformations, You, Win, Stop, Sink, Defeat, Push Objects: Baba, Rock, Wall, Water, Skull, Flag , (Grass, Tree, Tile, Background elements exist, but don't interact with anything) NOTE: When controlling multiple objects at once, pushing other things into walls / things that apply stop, will cancel all movement (haven't found a good hack for that yet) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I did it! THERE'S NO UNDO OR RESTART FEATURE!!!!!! how do you make it so that you can win by coming into contact with something like baba coming into contact with the flag for example very gud i like it i would be so stoked if u made a "full version" or just more levels in general i would definitely recommend playing this how do you beat the big river one? you do how do you finish the level with a lot of water? (no, not the smol river one, the huge river one. Make the water pushable, then make the rock the victory How do you do the level with the river? I think I need to be able to go through walls to finish it but I can't make myself go through walls. rock is win It's alright. Though, the rules are more difficult to use, because words aren't written out. There's also a lot of feedback effects missing. It would be nice if you added something of your own to differentiate it from the original. its a demake... its supposed to be as similar as possible but worse lolll</TEXT>

<TEXT>WASD/Arrow Keys to move Z to undo R to restart If the game does not work for you or you are on mobile, try this link: https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=be9cf6d355003371750d6950646022e5 A PuzzleScript demake of the mechanics seen in the early levels of the game Baba Is You developed by Arvi Teikari. The goal for this project is that in any scenario that can be created in the level editor, the tiles will have the exact same functionality they would in the original game. To use the level editor, click the above link, press the "hack" button at the bottom of the screen, then press the "level editor" button that appears at the top of the screen. P.S. The PuzzleScript game engine has a maximum tile resolution of 5x5 pixels, thus the words have been abbreviated to their first letter. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Make hot and melt and add a level where you can horizontally write Flag IS Hot. wait how tf is this possible Nice it's like the original Baba Is You but for broke ppl Would recommend playing but unfortunately it's too short Whenever I hack the code, I can't move the player. @Galatical Do you still have the source code? Can you send it to me? Hmm, I just checked and you're right. The source code has always been what you see there, so I think some sort of weird PuzzleScript bug introduced in an update must have caused this. Either way, I removed the first line that created a player object on every tile and simply gave the play a letter in the legend and placed it manually in the corner of each level, and that fixed it. I've updated the link that says "If the game does not work for you, or you are on mobile, try this link" to a new, working version. See if that works for you! now we have two baba is you in puzzlescript https://pyjamads.itch.io/baba-is-you-demake ð Why are text so unreadable?? The engine I used to make this, PuzzleScript, is very limited. The maximum sprite size is 5x5 pixels, the best I could do to represent words is to just put the first letter of the word. This makes understanding the game nearly impossible if you havenât played the original, but itâs the best I could do with the tools. Iâd recommend checking out the âPuzzleScriptâ tag on itch.io to see more examples of games made using the engine, thereâs a lot of good ones.</TEXT>

Gaming group years ago encountered a Hawktopus. My wife drew a rendition of it and the encounter has been oft referenced since, so they were thrilled to see that they are in Mork Borg in the form of bird squid. I missed the Kickstarter for the print (and that Frontier Scum book). Is there any way to still get them? Check kartellian vaults Hey! Just want to say you did great job with this book.

Other sources of print being considered? Yes to both questions. Hey ! Thanks for the awesome comments. We have not forgotten the project, we also would love to see this in print some day. I'll see what we can do about it. Get that print copy kickstarted and I will THROW money at this. Just checking back in to see if a print version might be in the works. My god, kickstart the fuck out of this! Any uupdate on a print version? This book,it produces corpses that I can scavenge. 10/10 Would kill my players again.

Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Very nice parallax, excellent opening house animation but I didn't appear on screen at first and wasn't sure what was happening. The second time I played I wasn't anywhere at all and the controls didn't seem to bring me into frame...! Good starting base, I really hope there are more updates because I love the idea. One sentence review: "Keep that cauldron bubbling for I foresee a bright future for this witch!" Thank you for the encouragements ! Indeed I forgot to block the updates of the movements of the player during the intro. A playable version and a little more interesting should arrive within a few weeks with a complete level and a big boss in vector drawing. Lovely intro :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a short game that I made for the GDKO 2023 Jam. It is in a pretty rough state, but it is still kind of fun. Even if I don't do well in the jam, I learned a lot about timing, even though this isn't my first jam. Controls: Arrow keys to move, Right click to select weapon, hold LMB to fire. Press R to go back to the menu. While you are technically only supposed to move left and right, some mechs have trouble with slopes, so I added the ability to "fly" by holding the Up arrow. Notes: -Each mech loads into a different layout. The layouts are virtually identical, but I do not know if this is not allowed for the jam, since it specifies 1 level only -The player is currently indestructible -I do not know if the game is framerate dependent or if it is choppy at different framerates -I know that the walking animations are weird looking Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>A baba is you prototype (Re-coded, unofficial)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows A challenge I took up (I just know the basics of programmation). The complexity of its game design motivated me to try this out. There is still some bugs, specially when you controll different objects at once. I know I coded it any old how, and I did things in a probably really complex way when there are obviously a lot simplier ones, but I did my best. I got sprites and gifs and other visuals, either on the wiki page, or directly into the game by screening tiles by tiles and recreating gifs manually, or getting sounds from gamefiles. ------------------------------ Features : - Verbs : YOU, WIN, PUSH, STOP, SINK, DEFEAT, RED, BLUE - Logic : IS, NOT, AND -Objects : a lot -Undo function (not working if you undo a sink) - Around 20 levels - The hub/map - Saving progress - A konami code - My test room (with F11), if you want to play with rules - Bugs of course - Probably other things I forget Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

Jumping on enemies (the red balls) will make them green. You can grab them once they're green. Grabbed enemies can be thrown or consumed for a powerful double or triple jump. It was originally intended to make a boss battle where the small minions would be used against the boss. But alas, the time limit was exceeded...

While the art isn't as good as it could be, I feel I got most of the core mechanics and words into the game. I reversed engineered the entire project by just playing the original game and figuring out how the code would work. Although I didn't add too many levels, I did create a level editor so you could make your own with the words I added. See if you could play around with the logic and find a bug!

<TITLE>Horror Vacui</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Horror Vacui was created as a solo project/first ever game by Skelefactor founder Tony Ransom. It was designed to be a game that is simple to pick up, but also to continually surprise the players. The basic premise is that you must clear a series of rooms by controlling each floor tile in each room. Various enemies wander about, stealing your control from each tile that they walk on. You can destroy the enemies, but only by powering up through the claiming of tiles. A strange sort of resource management and suspense arises from the dynamic of tile claiming and enemy take-downs. Though Horror Vacui's development may be completed, we at Skelefactor are committed to the life-long support of all of our games. From time to time we'll get ideas on how to enhance a particular aspect, or a player will alert us to an obscure bug. As long as we're alive, we're going to keep making these things better. skelefactor.com Click download now to get access to the following files:</TEXT>

I cannot claim it for some reason and when i try to extract it it says "Opening the files may be harmful to your computer" so why cant i claim it and why does it say that? can someone explain? Hello I made the sale 100% off with out the option to claim because of bots. It says its harmful because its not codesigned like every other game on itch.io lol Heya fellas. Dev Hell, Texas When I say this is a masterpiece and a true work of art! Full body of work! Where do I begin? Itâs an anthology series, full play! No one of the various game starts...I don't know why :( It's just a dark screen, no errors or other things Sorry! Try to put the game folder on your desktop. with this folder struture: Desktop/Horror Games To Play In The Dark/TheGame.exe I'm sorry, but is this a video game or a movie? Stop taking control away from the player, it's annoying! What are you scared of not being in control? Haha I'm joking. Sorry for your experience. If you bought the game, contact me on discord for a refund, happy to reimburse if you hate it that much - David Hate? No, I donât hate your game. I just donât like this type of thing, thatâs all. Itâs a good game, but the cinematic camera is a little annoying. Itâs like, âLook, blood! Look, buildings! Look, a dead bear!â And Iâm just like, âCan I play, please? I have two eyes, I can see. It feels like a âpress W and watch a cinematicâ simulator. Maybe the game will be more fun in the future episodes, but the first one is everything. Yah it's not for everyone. Cabin, Luggage and BULLIED have this mechanic. Stay away from those and try the others out. Let me know what you think of the others - David Amazing collection of spooky stories with a movie-like vibe and creepy mysteries. Each story brings fresh scares, from entities to mind-bending horror, tied by a mysterious thread. The visuals and sounds are amazing. Gameplay is smooth, controls change slightly between stories , and it gives fresh feeling. Itâs a super fun horror game! I'm glad you enjoyed it, stay following for further plans and updates! - David Thanks for the video, it's also one of my favorites too, hoping to expand on that one in the future - David Great games. I played in one 90 minute sitting. I love game packs like this. Reminds me of the christmas horror collections ("Madvent Calendar") Glad you enjoyed it! This should be more of Halloween horror collections haaha but yeah Madvent is cool! Thank you for the video! Not Sure why. When i click start its just a black screen. was looking forward to playing this. So sorry about that, can you try unziipping to your desktop and make sure the folder structure is desktop/horror games to play in the dark/horror games to play in the dark.exe? It might be Windows Defender blocking the games from being started. Add them as exclusions in the settings, or launch each game individually and click on "Run Anyway" after the pop up. Then it should work from there. Donât click Run Away!! Click Run Anyway ððð Crap!! Fixed it now hahaha really fun list of games, i hope to see more of this type of compilations in the future Thanks so much!! We do plan on making another volume! Either with a Kickstarter, or funding it through our sales on Steam. -Ari - Cabin / Episode 1 = 7.5 - Antler / Episode 2 = 8 - Grandpa's Board / Episode 3 = 7.5 - Huldufolk / Episode 4 = 7.5 - Unknown Location / Episode 5 = 7 - Luggage / Episode 6 = 8 - Abducked / Episode 7 = 8 - El Masmelo / Episode 8 = 9 - Bullied / Episode 9 = 9 Overall Score = 71.5 / 9 = 7.94 â 8.00 (Great) We appreciate your video and ratings! -Ari I had so much fun playing this game. I uploaded it to my YouTube channel "Gamingwithzems." Super unique, I hope to see another collage of random horror games. I loved El Maselo, Abducked, and Grandpa's Board Game. 10/10. Keep up the great work! Great video! It was entertaining, and it was funny seeing you play antler with the old school tank controls lol - David Hey there! I do youtube videos as well and if it helps, you can link your videos here by clicking on the three dot button next to your video in studio and click the option that says "get shareable link" and when you post it here in your comment itll show the video! I often go through the comments watching other tubers videos on here! good luck and keep up the good work :D Hey! Thanks , I appreciate you letting me know! 10/10, would definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys low poly horror Thank you! Glad you enjoyed our game! -Ari hi! any way to purchase this w/o a paypal account? thank you in advance for your response! You have 3 options 1. join our discord and we can find another way 2. wait for a 100% off sale 3. I think your able to still use PayPal without an account, just use checkout with debit/credit. But not entirely sure. I just know PayPal has this when I've sent invoices. - David hi again! it's been resolved. i managed to purchase somehow through paypal. love the game(s)! This is a fantastic anthology game with collection of 9 games, all of them were really unique and had different kind of systems and mechanics. For sure one of my favorite anthology games out there. Here's my simple rating for each game: (keep in mind I'm deaf so my experiences may be different than yours) Cabin: 7/10 - The atmosphere is really creepy, great build up for the ending. I also like the animations. Antler: 8/10 - Love the old-school controls, I really enjoyed playing around with it. The camera shots in this game are just perfect, great build up to the end too. Was bummed out that this game doesn't have subtitles for some conversations, but I still had fun in this one. Grandpaâs Boardgame: 8.5/10 - My personal favorite. Interesting game with a well-written story that slowly becomes dark, great atmosphere that goes well with the characters. Very grateful that this one has text dialogues! Huldufolk: 6.8/10 - I was a bit confused because there were no subtitles for the conversation, still enjoyable regardless. The atmosphere design is VERY liminal, the ending was fairly simple but still worth playing! Unknown Connection: 7/10 - Short and simple, but the ending scared the hell out of me. I wasn't expecting that at all haha. Luggage: 6.8/10 - The story was a bit confusing for me, maybe it's because I can't hear or no subtitles. The ending was pretty messed up. Abducked: 7.2/10 - Adorable game with a dark and twisted ending... short but sweet. El Masmelo: 6.5/10 - Fairly simple game, the ending was creepy. And why is my son Freddy Krueger? XD Bullied: 7.5/10 - I was excited for this one, but unfortunately no subtitles so I was a little out of context. But the game did a great job helping me understand more about the story through visualization. I would've given it a higher rating only if I could hear the conversations. Really dark ending about bullying problems. Highly recommend for horror game enjoyers, go get this game! Thanks so much for the detailed review, we love your opinions on the individual episodes! We'll let you know when we're done working on bringing subtitles into the game! -Ari Thank you for playing, glad you loved it! Bullied my favorite too - David Best horror anthology game Iâve played! Iâm a huge fan of horror anthologies, and Horror Games To Play In The Dark definitely delivered. It features 9 unique episodes, and each one gets crazier than the last. I wonât spoil anything, but if you love horror experiences that keep you guessing, I highly recommend picking this up! Episode Ratings & Thoughts: Cabin â 7.5/10 The enemy model here is amazing—feels like it came straight out of a Lovecraftian nightmare. ------- Antler â 7.9/10 The ending totally caught me off guard. I was expecting something else, but it went wild in the best way. Also, it's the longest episode in the game. ------- Grandpaâs Boardgame â 8/10 That plot twist at the end? Crazy. It ends on a cliffhanger and honestly could be expanded into a full standalone game. ------- Huldufolk â 7/10 Not as intense as the others, but I liked it. The Huldufolk reminded me a lot of the Duwende from Philippine folklore. ------- Unknown Connection â 7.3/10 Short, simple, and straight to the point. The ending still managed to surprise me though! ------- Luggage â 8.2/10 I thought it would be a typical main-character-vs-enemy episode, but nope—I was so wrong in the best way. ------- Abducked â 7.4/10 Just a chill duck game. I mean… nothing scary about ducks, right? ------- El Masmelo â 7.6/10 Remember my expectations from the Antler episode? This one did a great job living up to them. No disappointment here! ------- Bullied â 9/10 A true horror experience. Easily one of the best episodes in the game for me. It hit hard, especially because Iâve been through something similar in real life. ------- Overall Score: 9/10 This anthology was an emotional rollercoaster with a wide range of tones, scares, and surprises. Whether you're in it for disturbing psychological themes or bizarre horror concepts, thereâs something here for every horror fan. Canât wait to see more from the devs! Keep up the amazing work, I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for future releases! ^_^ Thanks for your comment, I appreciate that you rated each one individually, without spoilers. I'm very grateful that this is your favorite anthology so far it boosts my confidence in game dev, and I seriously hope I can get a volume two out in the future. It's fun making short horrors, I just need to find a proper pipeline to get another volume out in a decent time. It was definitely a roller coaster of Dev Hell making these too! ð¥ - David Comments below clip: The first installment of the 'Horror Games To Play In The Dark' series, that the DEVs have gratuitously offered for free [for the time being]. For that, I'm thankful. Furthermore, the first game is/was very interesting, as you end up in the woods, a place you share with bears. I didnât run into any bugs, hiccups or other snags. Kudos to all involved and thanks for making this awesome game. Thank you for playing, glad you enjoyed it! how to play this for free? Wait for another sale. If your a YouTuber, I'll give you a key Any idea when there's another sale? It's fine if you don't feel comfortable answering that! Join the discord server, and Ill go ahead and give you the game, as long as you leave an honest review. - David thank you so much for making the game free I know im not the first to say that, but on this platform I can actually own the game. so from the bottom of my heart thank you. Thank you for the kind words, I hope you enjoyed the game. I let it be free every now and then, so that anyone can get the chance to play it! Hi, thank you for making your game free, I appreciate both your work and the generosity to the gaming community. I'm going to play to it and publish a gameplay video on yt No problem, I let it go free every now and then so anyone can play it. Looking forward to your video! Very interesting, creepy collection of short horror games. Keep it up. Thank you gonna check it out soon! I can't play Grandpa's Boardgame. I start the game on the rooftops and I remain stuck there Can you get a screenshot? Wow I never seen this happen ð so your saying you literally just start the game on top like that? I remember one time I had a similar situation with one person that would be somewhere else when all other plays would be normal. It was because that player was in the EU, and the numbers in my code had to be localized.. but idk if this is the case here, since I've seen gameplay from people all over. But I'm sorry for your experience I'm gonna look into it. I do hope you have enjoyed the other episodes? I did. Very cool games I'm glad you liked them, I will let you know when I discover the issue. Thanks for reporting Hello! I discovered the issue you where experiencing. While testing I played it on my 4k screen. And ran into this issue, then I tried it in other resoulutions which the only one that worked on my 4k is 1080p. Can you try playing this game in 1080p to confirm this issue? NICE lmao Best gameplay I seen so far. I like the black screen, how it covers everything up and how you can only hear the game! I like the first short story because it has a strong atmosphere in the first person. I made a video hoping you will also like it ãHorror Games To Play In The Darkã https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13gbXztEZY/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=8f8... Thank you for playing, glad you liked the 1st one! - Bob</TEXT>

<TITLE>Horror Cartridge Collection$6.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1873140/ On a street so lonely, in a town so quiet, stands a mall no more, but a place for the old and unwanted, in plain sight to all, but very few enthralled. Yet in this dimness, a strange sight does appear, the building's windows aglow, as if to cheer, amidst the darkness, they shine so clear, a beacon of hope, dispelling fear. When night is broken, the end is awoken, but until then, don't run too fast, don't be too rash, Or your demise might arise. That, I am certain. Horror Cartridge Collection is a series of short form horror games in the PSX style, with each game (Cartridge) offering a unique experience with different gameplay mechanics, styles and stories all connected by the mall. Out Of Gas Your car has just run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. A sign tells you a gas station is only two miles up the road. Make your way to it on foot. Nightmare You are a young child who has woken up in the middle of the night after hearing a sound coming from downstairs. Investigate the sound and remember, don't panic. The Mine The sun has set, it's time to descend into the mine in search of riches. Take your trusty pickaxe and lantern in the exploration for ore and other treasures. Warehouse 14 It's 2am and you have just scaled the wall to get into a warehouse park. A friend told you one of the warehouses is storing something valuable, find warehouse 14, break in and steal what's inside. M.A.D It's the height of the Cold War and the launch order has just been sent. Take control of your launch control center and perform your duty to your country. Santa's Workshop It's Christmas eve and all the toys have been assembled, but now they need to be packaged and put into Santa's bag for delivery. You are a freshly hired elf tasked with taking the assembled toys and packaging them ready for children to open on Christmas day, work fast, midnight is approaching. Eternal Storage You have just purchased an abandoned storage unit and have arrived at the facility to clear it out, find the unit and start clearing out all the junk, keep your eye out for anything that looks valuable, you never know what you might find. Resolve Your Fate A mysterious book has been left at the door, but beware the power that's held inside. Can you overcome the curse and free yourself? Or will you succumb and meet your fate. Long Barrow Four to be laid to rest. Take them to the long barrow and find a spot inside for each one. Get it done quick before the sun goes down, the dead donât like to be disturbed at night. And be wary of speaking to the dead, they may answer you back.

Will it come one day on Steam? Thank you. The game is already on steam, at the top of the page right below the discord server is a black and white play button, press it to see a Steam widget for the game. Ah, thank you, I didn't notice. Cheers! This is a fantastic bunch of games all with their own unique story and challenges! I can't wait to discover what secrets this old mall is hiding! hey i made an entire video covering the entire game enjoy I like what I see here so far. I'll definitely be back for the full version. I can't wait to see what comes next! Thanks for the fun! Out of Gas - Conceito simples mas bem feito, senti falta de jumpscares mas bom jogo mesmo assim. Nightmare was awesome! Definitely a lot more spooky. Though I totally found the voice messages again (or what I'm guessing will be the voice messages). I kinda have a talent for finding bugs XD. Still, great experience, can't wait to play the last one that is available currently. The Mine was also cool, the eyes in the darkness really got to me, though I feel like there could have been more ambiance sounds. Still, a cool and spooky experience. Oh and I totally found the voice messages again though I couldn't interact with them. I played Out of Gas and had a lot of fun playing, I had difficulty getting one of the endings but I figured it out, my favorite character was grandma. Played only the first one thus far but already I'm having quite a bit of fun with it. I also love the little hidden developer notes you can find, it's a really nice addition. Going to be playing the other two games available soon, but can't wait to see the whole thing being released, keep up the good work dev(s)! Thanks, the developer commentary being included is actually a bug as it's not finished yet but it will be included in the full game along with a ton of extra stuff, hope you enjoy the other cartridges and check out the full game on the 23rd April. Really loving this game so far! Going to finish this series for sure Click it if you're cute, if you're not, click anyways. Good start to a series. As you requested I returned, still brilliant mate, absolutely loving it I may have run into a bug on "The Mine". I lost almost all light after the torches went out and couldn't see anything. I thought it was supposed to be that way and ended up having a frustrating time finishing the game. I had to crank the brightness all the way up to be able to get through it. :) Sorry to hear, You should be able to turn your lantern back on with "F", will check and add a button prompt to help players in future I think the problem is, once I l turned it on I had no reason to turn it off so I completely forgot there was a button. ð It was still fun besides me putting myself in super hard mode. GREAT!! out of gas was better than nightmare, but nightmare was still good. Loved it! This is fantastic. Can't wait for game 3 . Another great addition to the collection! I've played and loved both games so far and I'm already anxiously awaiting the next. Great Job and keep it up! Another great one, I enjoyed it! Enjoyed cartridge 2 as well! Color me excited, Tillion! Chapter Two has been released! Honestly had a lot of fun with this one! Really enjoyed Out Of Gas, and super excited to play the next Cartridge! Played as part of a 3 Scary Games video with future plans of unlocking ALL achievements/endings for another video. Really, really well done! Time stamps in the description to jump to this game! i love these type of games and how you could have multiple endings keep up the great work linux pls A Linux port will be created within the coming months once more content has been released thanks m8 comuter i shit have -yoda This was a really cool game! I loved playing through and getting all of the endings. Can't wait to play your other games are when released. Game starts at 4:34 Awesome work! I am really looking forward to the other games! I would say the ability to have save points would really help to get the endings, but I really enjoyed each ending. Hello, I played this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Loved all the endings and the whole experience, from the gamely to every sound effect it was great, and thank you for helping me out with one of the endings, interested to see what's next, good work :) Youtube videos reposted after switch from discussion board to comments </TEXT>

I'm kinda worried about missing it. Generally every Party Member has optional dialogue in story cutscenes, so it's kind of impossible to see every one. I don't mean in story cutscenes, I mean optional dialogue. Like when the two kids are arguing about who would win and Jekyll makes a comment if you have him. Is that a Moment now or is it not signposted? Hi, I can help you localize your game in French to increase your sales! Hit me up if you're interested :) BUG REPORT The room with the fusebox in the police station has a Creepy that doesn't work properly. It doesn't trigger a battle, even when interacted with. All it does is face the party for one frame and give me 500 candy without telling me. How is it even giving me candy when the battle script isn't being triggered? Also, wasn't there meant to only be one Creepy in the police station? Are you playing the most recent build? That was in a much earlier build that was patched out. I don't know. I didn't download it from itch, but I commented here so you'd be more likely to see it. What version has the fix? I can't find it in the steam patch notes. It was fixed in a hotfix patch shortly after 1.0.2 so it was not included in any patch notes, but I would recommend downloading the latest version (1.1.2) because a lot more bugs than that got fixed since. HEY BATWORKS TEAM! I'm a Porter form the PortMaster project. I love your game. its so fun. we have ported a handful of RPGMaker games to our library and id really like to add yours. But for some reason the log i get shows me nothing. My guess is that your game has steam dependencies built in to the code and i am not well versed on RPGMaker engine at all. I was curious if you could possibly help me get your game onto PortMaster by getting me a copy of the game that has no Dependencies to Steam coded into it whatsoever. Like you would have made it a long time ago before steam existed or when you were making them to just put on itch. I'm guessing just the game.rgss3a file is what i'd need. I have purchased your game already so if you'd like me to prove that I have, i can do that for you. All this would do is make it so that i can make an xdelta3 patch, so that when people buy your game, the patch will compare their steam dependent game, with the patched game, and remove those files. They will still have to own your game to play it on their Linux Handhelds, because the files have to be copied over to the portfolder of your game. We do have some games that are free/open sourced, but where yours is paid, the game files wouldn't be included. My email is unusual.paladin@gmail.com if you wanna speak to me there or if you can send me a game where you've taken a moment to remove the steam dependencies. I hope to hear from you and get your awesome game onto PM soon!!! https://portmaster.games https://portmaster.games/games.html WOW, this still exists? I played the demo on Gamejolt a long time ago, I'm unfortunately still poor but I'll come back someday. completed the game... took me around 50 hours. had a blast all the way through! Completely worth the wait! Pretty cool game https://ghoullocalization.blog/ Good game Yipee!! Go play it if you haven't already! Bought it on Steam, is good. Peak Spooky do you like halloween? i like halloween. i like horrorvale. you would like horrorvale. THE GAME IS FINALLY OUT, GO PLAY IT NOW!! Just played Act 0 of the demo and found it very charming! Great humor, fun artwork, great stuff. I'm sure the full game is even better! Thank you! The Full Game is supposed to be out right now on Itch, but we ran into a snag with the upload limit. It'll hopefully be live here sometime today! I purchased the demo on here, wondering if I'll have to pay again for the full version of it will be a free download ð There won't be any additional cost! Ooh ok, wicked! So I imagine it should show up as a free download then. Thank you so much!! Also been following since 2019, so proud of what you've guys accomplished ð¥° I am the owner of a horror film and video game festival and this would be a cool game to enter into the festival. You would have to submit your game via this platform AND on our filmfreeway page to Qualify. We are offering a 50% discount code. You can use the code: HHFFGAMEJAM50 The Festival is Haunted House FearFest If You are a Winner, the winnerâs entry will receive an award and be celebrated by horror enthusiasts worldwide. https://itch.io/jam/haunted-house-fearfest I think this game is cool I played the game jolt version, and I assume they're the same better than undertale in my opinion,also,will the next chapters be free? man this was rlly fun, when the full game is out are we able to keep our progress? Unfortunately no! The build of the game available right now is from 2019 and the Full Version has changed so dramatically that an old save file wouldn't even load. Still, Act 1 has a lot of changes and new additions compared to the demo, so hopefully you'll have fun replaying it anyway. Hi I triedto figure out on steam what the situation was with the game? I expected two games that unfortunatly for you, I would get for free now. Anyway I didn't saw an update for the actual game or this one. I just wanted to ask what's going on at the moment. Hello! I apologize but I don't understand your question. The game is still in active development and gets monthly progress updates on our Patreon and Discord. Do you think you'll ever make it available to mac? I really hope this game someday comes out on Steam! It's fantastic. The music, the jokes, the gameplay — truly scratched my Halloween itch! Thanks a ton for even making it. Will keep my eye out its release ð§¡ Great news! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114650/HorrorVale/ (This is the same demo, but the full game will be released here as well as Itch) will it be free? hey is this free i love the game and hope to play it amazing game great designs clever combat uh....weird world? nice job ððð With what this game currently shows, I'm already in love with it! Best of luck on finishing the game, will definitely be picking it up again! I really enjoyed this game. I look forward to seeing the full release! Thank you so much! This was a very fun and cute game. It kinda reminded me of Costume Quest. Keep up the good work! Thanks for playing! i doubt my laptop can run it with smothly How long is it? The demo is roughly 3-4 hours! WOW!! Thank you!! Keep up the good work!!ðð i like this keep up the amazin work! honestly i enjoy this alot hope you guys enjoy it too:) I played through act 0 and I really enjoy the puzzles, battle mechanics and art style :) Thanks so much for checking it out! Absolutely wonderful! Love it so far, looking forward to seeing more <3 Keep up the great work! Hey Alarkus, I'm really interested in doing an Item Location walkthrough for all of the important key items and even items of less significance that still have applicable use. Is there any literature one can use to track these items down? Hey Violet, we don't actually have anything like that lying around, but if you hop into our discord, perhaps the Wiki community can help! This game is adorable :D Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYq7cZ4Q_oE</TEXT>

The team qGk ;) Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Let's say it need some work to do, keep it up and fix the issues, everyone can make a good game if they try hard enough The real horror experience is I can't move with W and A. Also, it looks unfinished. I tried to play this game a couple of times, but the only thing that I could do, after opening a bunch of doors, was to fall into the void out of the map. this game is the worst game ive ever played in my entire life (5 stars still i wanna trick people) This game is so bad. You only can move with "d" and all looks with sensivity with errors think good need fix Thank you QueenFaith for the time you take to test our Horror Experience! Yes it need some fixes we are bringing in :) like a little cross hair, the UI text bigger, and the map conception are in progress. We will update the game in the page as soon it will be available!

<TITLE>Horror</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows The Game "Horror" contains a variety of games, that are all very scary.... Cavern Mercy is an FPS game, that places the player in an almost isolated cave... The Cave contains many torches, that you can use to escape the Ghoul that lurks the cave. BUT BEWARE: He does not like it when you stop moving... Classic Slender man, can you collect all 8 pages without Slender man finding you? Alien Unknown is a game based off the Alien Trilogy, with the player left on a spaceship which has broken down. While the others go down to fix the problem, you are left to check that everything is under control. But you hear something is close, something is with you on that Floor, you are not alone… By TaintedFlame Games. Trailer Video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtNMzaWKQw0&feature=youtu.be Horror v1.0.2 Update 2021: Things are coming.. Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Ñ Ð¾Ð±Ð¾ÑÑÐ°Ð»ÑÑ found out how to start the game but I shouldnt have to go to the comments to get a fucking tutorial on how to start the game. also, if you want to play a different game you have to close the whole ass application and open it again and oh my god this game is so God damn sluggish and bad. Turning with your mouse is a nightmare and incredibly slow. I literally could not move in the alien game. Slender is Slender but if Slender but if it was made in a high school programming class and slender already sucks absolute fucking multiple scrotums and one huge cock. The cavern one was ok and only ok but it didnt stop me for just playing the game for 7 minutes it's good for what it is but as a package its ass. Scared my pants off Its very horror :o noice lol The menu don't want to work. I can't use the buton "exit" neither the "story" mode. bababou OMG the alien 1 scared the living heck out of m Im having the same issue as a previous comment: how do I start the game? My cursor doesn't seem to want to select start or even exit. Is there any way to fix this issue? I don't know if you still have this private because 10 months ago but you're supposed to click to the left of it kind of weird but it's the same for every thing you have to press in game and the menu. Not bad. Ok, understand, most people are trying to be nice... I'm sorry but you need a lot of work on how to create games. Because my mouse did not stay on screen long enough for me to actually get away from the threat in any mode, this game sucks, in my eyes. Please, learn as much as you can before uploading a new one. its not ez to make games so maybe you should SHUT UP no need to be rude just play something else dang I realize I was being rude, it was uncalled for and I apologize for that. I decided to give it another try and this game really does need a lot of work. I have created a few games myself and have worked in game development with a few teams. Yes, I agree that it's difficult to create a full functioning game but I have learned that, it is better to hold off on the upload until the game experience is acceptable. If the user experience isn't good, it could really tarnish your reputation and hurt your chances in building an audience. Again, I apologize for my rudeness and should've given constructive criticism instead on bashing on the dev. Hopefully though, they have been working on their programming and are creating better games since the creation of this one. I also wish them the best of luck. Hey, no worries your response was more than fair. The game was made by two 13 year olds 5 years ago, rushed out for a Halloween release. In that time we've continued to learn how to make actual games. Have a look at our newer stuff (even though they're all game jam games), they show what we've been improving on much more. Any game that we release in the future will be much much much more polished than this, and it won't look like it was made by a couple of 13 year olds. Thank you for the respectful follow up message. All the best. I'm glad you accepted my apology. Also, I tried out "Rite of Insanity," assuming it was your latest game and it was strange but pretty unique. I didn't understand what was going on or what the objective of it all was but, I enjoyed it. I'm happy to see how you have improved from this game and respect that. Good luck guys and I hope to play some more of your work! Keep it up. Hey, Rite of Insanity is a bit of a strange game, however we made it in 48 hours only over a weekend for the KiwiJam game jam, so it's not intended for a full release and was made just for fun :) straight fact How do I supposed to click "Story" or "Exit"? I randomly pressed on anything I could on the keyboard until I quickly noticed the "Exit" is highlighted red before it wore off. Is there any other ways to click "Story" or what? You have to click on the side of it, it's weird its the same for the games too when you want to click on something you click to the side of it not on it. Im having the same problem... Did you find a way around it? its not har How u did it then? Pretty cool, nice idea. great work I like alien unknown best :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5eFqe_gLc dling looking forward to play</TEXT>

<TITLE>Ravenwood Horror</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Ravenwood Horror is a horror themed puzzle game. I made it a while back in 2008 (under the nickname Min Chan). But when I discovered this awesome site I decide to share it here as well for (hopefully) your enjoyment! It's made in RPG Maker VX. You assume the role of psychiatrist Henry Smith, who is trapped at the mansion of his recently gone crazy patient H. Wilkins. You need to explore and solve puzzles in order to escape and find out what is the cause of all this mess. Multiple endings depending on your actions (full exploration is rewarded!) and about 2 hours of gameplay for your first time. There is a hint walkthrough in the game files, and also a few let's plays videos on YouTube. This game is fanmade using resources not made by me and as such is a free game. However if you want to donate and help the bill paying while I'm working on my current project, you are more than welcome to do so! Thank you for taking the time to check the game out, I hope you enjoy! Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hello, Iâm a new RPGMaker translator of the Spanish community. After playing your Ravenwood Horror game (that I truly enjoyed a lot!) Iâd love to translate it into Spanish. May I have your permission? Greetings. Hello and thank you for your kind words! Sadly, I have lost the original project files so I don't think it's possible. Hello, Firstly, thank you for your kind response. To be honest, i didnât expect any answer whatsoever, since it was long ago since your last comment here. Donât worry about the original files. Thatâs not truly a big problem to make a translation. It wonât be so easy, but hey, i think your game deserves a good translation. Itâs up to you then. You can check my translation website if that makes you feel more comfortable. I have experience with this kind of projects, you can rest assure. https://realkiktraducciones.tumblr.com/ Greetings. i'm SO glad to find this game again! i played it when it was first put up on rpgmaker.net when i was a teen, probably around the year it was made, and it stuck with me. really excited to try it again, god, 13 years later? So glad to hear this! I hope it has aged somewhat decently and not leave you dissappointed wow this was cool! This game is awesome. I liked the soundtrack and the story. The characters are really insteresting. The puzzles aren't as hard as I thought, but at the same time that made it confusingly cool. Really worth it, awesome work!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Horror Prelude Music Pack</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Designed for RPG Maker, this 10-track pack aims to supplement your horror-mystery game with instrumental compositions. A copy of the terms of usage is included in the download files. Please read it before using it, but in short, credit me (CeremonialDoll3702) in all occasions, and also remember to send me a free copy of the game if used in commercial games (edit: please just forget about sending me a copy from now on... that was such a stupid rule. I now waive the requirement to send me a free copy.). 10 tracks, with some extra "soundscape" tracks. Some extra SE (RPG Maker sound effects), and some ME (music effects) are also included. If you simply want to use this in your game, download the first file (with ogg, mp3), and simply copy all the ogg files (or mp3 files, just that I personally recommend ogg over mp3) into their respective folders. If you want to also want to remix, or to do some editing on the tracks themselves for your personal usage, you should download the uncompressed flac files first. If you donate at least $3 to me through itch.io on this product (which means I get $2.7 with the default share, so if you want to do it any other way that results in me getting $2.7 through itch.io, I am fine with it), the crediting rule and the give me a free copy of your commercial game rule is waived. See the LICENSE.txt file for more details. And just in case it gets confusing: donating is optional for using the music, please read the LICENSE.txt in the downloaded files. Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I love these tracks! Can't wait to download and try them out in my game. Will gladly donate the $3 and still give you credit, etc. Hello, I would love to get in touch with you, I have been looking for a way to contact you but all your accounts seems to be abandoned... In Project1, RPG Maker Forum and "here". Well, this is the most recent site you use to connect, if you have a discord please add me, i'm Axsajim#5553 Ok. I have tried to add you. The tag is TaciturnGrove#0122. I don't know if you still want to get in touch with me or not tho Absolutely love this music! My game will be free anyway and will have it on my itch page in a few months! Thank you so much :) out yet? I read the previous comment about somebody using the music in their game and asking if you wanted a copy, I just wanted to let you know I'm using this in my game as well. I would be glad to send you a free copy of the game when it's fully complete if you get more time to play games in the future! You will be credited accordingly in the credits of the game. Also i'd just like to say, The music in this pack is absolutely beautiful and I will definitely continue to use it in the future! I'm sorry i just have to compliment this pack one more time. I've had the track labeled "occasion01" on a loop for about an hour and a half and it's just beautiful. i play it while i update my project and i love it. you really are very talented. if anyone is contemplating getting this, do it. it's very much worth it. hey, I'm using this pack in my game and would like to send you a copy, or a video so that you can see how we utilized it. Please email me at cmag1019@gmail.com. Recently due to work I don't have time to really view or enjoy others' games, so feel free to use it anyway you like. I don't think I can require people to send me copies anymore. If you are concerned about that rule in the terms of use I hereby waive it. I understand. thank you for your contribution to our game, you will be credited accordingly. I also hope to someday commission you for more music, we greatly enjoy the pieces you put out. if you get to a point where you have more time and would like to see or play, just email me and I'll send you a link for download, not as a requirement but as a thank you. have a great day :) Wow, amazing <3 !!! I agree with the last person that the one song shown way out passes most game maker type music to buy and at such a low price! Thank you Wow, these are some really high quality songs. Did you make these yourself? I mean, one piece is better than all of RPG Maker's tracks combine. Well done.</TEXT>

Just donated and picked these up! Can't wait to get these into my game! They sound great! Thank you. Hi thanks for providing so cool sounds. we used one stinger sound as an easteregg it in our calm clicker game: https://nubels64.itch.io/the-first-bloom (when you hover with the mouse over the version number in the main menu) Hola! Â¿Puedo usarlo en un juego de terror en RPG Maker? Gracias! Hola. Estoy usando el Traductor de Google, asÃ­ que me disculpo si esto no tiene mucho sentido. Â¡Puedes usarlo en cualquier proyecto que quieras! Gracias por tu interÃ©s. Thanks! :) Hello! I used some of your assets in my survival horror demo. I will be using more assets from you! Love them, you can take a look in: https://dfmr96.itch.io/sounds-from-beyond Hey! Game looks great. I would love to work with you to make some custom horror sounds just for you game if needed! By your description, the price should have gone up to $5 as of Aug 09, 2018, but this is still free to download. Was that an oversight? An oversight in editing, yes. The pack is free now. I made it available to everyone due to a severe lack of interest on the GameDev community's part. Until I made it free and posted it on Reddit. Haha. That is the downside of globalizing the amateur art world. The people who create for the joy of creating and/or getting attention turn it into a buyerâs marker within a generation or two. Anyway, thanks for that. Now that everything is nice and clear, it being under CC-BY certainly means itâs suitable for my list of libre-licensed assets. Hereâs hoping itâll add a donation or two to what you receive. (I certainly plan to donate something to each set of assets I use when I get back to working on my platformer projectâ¦ given that the public domain tileset that inspired it isnât set up to accept donations, Iâm planning to CC0 the extension to it that Iâve drawn once the platformer comes out. I think Iâve at least doubled the number of available tiles.) Sounds amazing! Thank you ð</TEXT>

Proposta Este projeto Ã© o resultado de um ano do meu Trabalho de ConclusÃ£o de Curso e, apesar de ter sido pensado para ser mais extenso, foi realizado apenas o capÃ­tulo um do enredo. A proposta principal deste jogo Ã© trabalhar questÃµes sobre a bruxaria na Idade Moderna por meio de uma personagem bruxa que tivesse caracterÃ­sticas mais significativas, contornando estereÃ³tipos misÃ³ginos que foram consolidados ao longo dos sÃ©culos a respeito da bruxa histÃ³rica. Em outras palavras, desenvolver uma bruxa que tivesse mais voz e empoderamento a fim de enfrentar os preconceitos de sua Ã©poca. Enredo No auge da InquisiÃ§Ã£o, Lilith, uma jovem camponesa, passa a sonhar com a figura do bode. Preocupada com o que isso possa significar, ela tenta se redimir de seus pecados, mas acaba conhecendo no caminho uma mulher suspeita e mal falada na Vila que comeÃ§a a incitar nela o desejo de revolta contra as obrigaÃ§Ãµes impostas pela sua famÃ­lia e pela igreja local. Lilith descobrirÃ¡, entÃ£o, que existe outra opÃ§Ã£o para sua vida pacata, um caminho sem volta em direÃ§Ã£o Ã bruxaria. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Mt bom :v obrigada! <3</TEXT>

<TITLE>Horror on Holiday Rails</TITLE>
<TEXT>This game was made in 7 days for the Scream Season game jam. Your goal is to collect the presents from the front of the train and bring them to the back without getting caught by the horror patrolling the train cars. NOTE: Due to browser updates, the Armory Engine can no longer lock your mouse in windowed mode or on anything besides Chrome. Firefox will not lock your mouse and you will be unable to turn unless you use the arrow keys which are assigned to tank controls. Internet Explorer/Edge is not supported by the Armory engine because that browser is trash. If you're going to play in browser, you must play it on Chrome in fullscreen for mouse input, use the tank controls/arrow keys, otherwise download the game. If you're experiencing performance or loading issues, we also recommend the downloadable version. We hope you enjoy this short game!

Pretty cool game I love the use of a moving train at the level and hiding under tables is a pretty good mechanic. This was a fantastic game!! Had loads of fun playing it!! Although there was a glitch in the game where she kept walking into the wall, so made it kinda easy lol...still had fun with it though. thats amazing keep going! she got stuck. kkkkkkk Howwww..????.. A girl got stuck under the bench in my gameplay.... bug Amazing Game!! So much Fun!!! Thanks for making this game! Merry Christmas! Im not playing this again, should have told me about the jumpscares Just kidding it just really scared me, thought i was sneaky hiding by the door then she opened it walked, didnt notice me until she walked back Awesome Game but too short 4/5. :) itputakatsura monster keeps getting stuck on door and cant move can you fix? I am so addicted to this game, but its not a clicker! I have played this game so much (20 times) but cant get enough! Lets get another scream jam for part 2? M O N K E M O N K E M O N K E if you open a door and hide behind it the monster cant get you. A mistake i wish i never made. I fricking love this lol So scary and thrilling! >:D good game i had a heart attack when playing this lol Being a fan of Consistency 3Dâs games already, I thought this one would be perfect to play for obvious reasons. Like the developerâs other games, I had a blast with it. Now, the sooner I get a One-Way Ticket Ep.3, the better Iâll feel about life. when she finds me and trys to kill me i when under a table and she got stuck I really enjoyed playing this game. SKIP TO 3:55!!! Thank you, we really appreciate it! Yes, the armory engine is only on version 0.6, so it might not have been the best choice for us, at least for the load times and the audio stuttering. The AI running into the door was definitely our bad, we thought we fixed that! We appreciate the review and the let's play! Fun little game! My channel (link opens in new tab) youtube.com/jonathick nice IE lol Another enjoyable Horror Game!! I really enjoyed the concept and it could be extended much further! (extended game coming soon maybe?) XD The skeleton creature and use of sound effects really had me hooked! I'm not too sure what the ending meant, but maybe a hint at something I didn't pick up on? Thanks Consistency for creating an awesome game! Very entertaining game! Got spooped few times. Also she got stuck few times on door. Still anyway fun game, concept is simple but it works on this game! Cool Game, Simple fun gameplay. love hiding under the table and seeing those beautiful legs :P Thanks for the Game : Here is quick gameplay Thanks for the support :P Thank you for the response, we really appreciate it, and fantastic work on the video too! We'll keep 'em coming and we hope you do too! Cute, Simple, and Scary. It's a good short experience, the actual scare is effective, and the game is well made for a game jam game. Only ran into one moment of weirdness where the creature wasn't able to catch me while I was under a table even though it was tracking me, but eventually it lost interest I guess and left me be. Thanks for the game! Thank you we appreciate it! Thanks for making a let's play, we loved it! This is fantastic! :) Thanks, TriVoxel, I appreciate you checking it out! I look forward to seeing more work from you!</TEXT>

Loved the look of the game, but unfortunately wasn't able to get out of the first few rooms - I'm using a Duelsense and I think I ran into some bugs. Still - great to see a fixed multicam game, and if you plan on making more of these consider getting in touch with us at the Fixed Camera Appreciation Society! Hi, I'm an UX/UI Artist, if you interested to collab please dm Hi! Are there plans for keyboard support? yes, absolutely Glad to hear that!</TEXT>

I'm trying to add mobile controls like for example a joystick, but how do I draw that on the screen? There's an official GameMaker tutorial for this you might be interested in: https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/multi-touch-joystick (Sorry for not explaining everything myself, but... Matharoo is a better teacher than me, anyway) Most of it should just work as-is since it uses the GUI layer, which works like normal in 3D mode. The one thing you might want to change here is to create the joystick instance yourself via code instead of placing them in the room editor (e.g. in obj_gamecontrol's room start / create event) to make sure it's aligned properly in every room, and run setup_gui_fog() before drawing the joystick and setup_game_fog() afterwards to turn off and on the lighting effects so they won't affect the GUI elements. How would I change the collectable from a 3d model to a 2d sprite? Draw it with draw_mode7sprite (one of the engine's scripts). The obj_antagonist draws itself that way, so you could just copy its drawing code: Thanks yal, Your kit is amazing! I'd love a Horror Engine: Escape. basically granny except simplified. Hello are all your games made by the gaming engine? All of them are made in GameMaker:Studio, if that's what you're asking. (Some of the old ones like Gun Princess use GameMaker 6 / GameMaker 8.1 instead, Studio is their direct successor) Very nice game engine I have a similar game engine from the same people Hello Yal! Very interesting! Does it support 3d models and ability to add some pathfinding for AI? Thanks! It's a Game Maker:Studio project file, so it has about as much support for those things as GMS has innately (there's no code for either of those at the moment - the level is a 3D model generated randomly, the enemy just teleports around randomly). I dug up a bunch of learning resources that could be useful: Ok!) Thank you! Dear Yal! Its all nice working but im facing some issue with terraincontrol object, when i click Play button my game freezing for 10 sec :(( I'll try compile with YYC but it didnt help. In the debug screen i saw just "Pause event has been registered for this frame" and "Pause event has been unregistered" after that Please, how can i fix this? Thanks! gms2 (ide 2.2.4.474, runtime 2.2.4.374) For some reason d3d_model generation is a lot slower in GMS2 than it is in GMS1. The easiest workaround would be to just add a loading screen and display that for the first step as the model is being built, a harder one would be do change the generation code to use vertex buffers instead. I looked into how the vertex buffer system works (I try to avoid everything that has a scary name :P) and it seems to not be super difficult to convert the game to use it. Sorry about the delay with the code fixes, it took some time to research it. Based on the example code on the GMS2 manual page on building primitives... 1) Define a vertex format (you'll need position data, texture data, and normal data - you should add them in the same order they're provided as arguments in the d3d_model_vertex/.../ functions) 2) Find the compatibility scripts for the various d3d_model scripts. If you've done any changes to the project, make a backup now, because we'll hack the compatibility scripts. 3) Change d3d_model_create() so it will create a vertex buffer and start a primitive using your custom format: 4) Change d3d_model_vertex_normal_texture() so that it will add vertex data. It's important you add this data in the same order you defined the different data in the vertex format. 5) Change d3d_model_draw() so it will submit the vertex buffer to the pipeline (using a texture): 7) d3d_model_primitive_end() could be emptied, or just use vertex_freeze() to make the vertex buffer read-only (which speeds up drawing it) Hope this helps! Let me know if there's any problems.</TEXT>

And quite frankly we didn't even tried to publish it because we know our game is not there yet, but we will keep working hard on the game so we can reach the level so we can get it published! We won't be updating the version of the build that is available for download, but in the future we will definitely support cross-buy if we will qet to Quest App store. In future updates: Flashlight feature, Replay ability, Better interaction with monsters etc.. If you would guys like to support us.

<TITLE>Rules & Roberts</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable roleplaying game A Social Justice Warrior, an Intersectional Paladin, a Rogue Worker... this can be you in Rules & Roberts! Engage in collective decision making while exploring perilous dungeons and fantastical realms. Rules & Roberts is a lightweight storytelling game that will introduce players to Robert's Rule of Order, a set of parliamentary procedures used by a wide range of democratic organizations. Rules & Roberts is light on mechanics, focuses on collaborative storytelling, and simplifies the work of the Dungeon Master. The players are adventures determined to bring justice, peace and freedom in a high fantasy universe. Being a radically democratic group, all of their actions are methodically debated and agreed upon. Instead of individualistically declaring their actions, each player proposes motions that are discussed, amended, and approved by the whole group following the Robert's Rules of Order process. Robert's Rules of Order is a manual establishing procedures for democratic decision making. It is widely used by a range of American organizations, including nonprofit associations, political groups, and trade unions. Being originally conceived in the late 19th century, its language and processes may appear formulaic and inaccessible to the uninitiated. This game aims to introduce these procedures in a compelling and humorous way.

The only thing that really bugged me was the coins hurting you rule. There are so many coins throughout the level and the enemies spawn too quickly that it's nearly impossible to take in the game since your character is flying around with damage. I would love to see how you pulled off some of those effects though!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game Name one thing you haven't done in D&D . No, not that. No, not that either. What? That's disgusting and we're glad you haven't done it. OK, LOOK. Grant's made rules for flying dungeons (and castles, keeps, large basements, wells) around the place, crashing into other dungeons, and stealing rooms you like for fun and profit. You could get a whole campaign out of this. Who wants your dungeon? Where can you fly your dungeon to? Can you fly your dungeon, or does it go where it wants with you sort of adjacent to it? This one page game is a set of rules that you can staple to the side of D&D . Pretty much any edition past third should function, and odds are it'll work with the new one as well. It can also play well in The Black Hack or Into the Odd if you ignore the Difficulty Class nonsense, and Mork Borg if you group the listed stats together like they did. If it's got a D20 you'll probably find a way to make it work. Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. lol,it's cool</TEXT>

<TITLE>Rules of My Best Friend's Body, a novel</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable book Arty and Larissa have the perfect relationship. Sheâs beautiful and afraid of her own popularity. He sits alone and draws comics. They're both social misfits—him obsessively, her secretly. They go to different schools, but they trade late-night phone calls and between-class meetings in Hebrew School. They never run out of things to say. Then one night, one of their common friends attacks Larissa in the darkest and most unforgivable of ways—the same night that Arty was planning to kiss her. Larissaâs world falls into a tailspin, and at the same time Arty's own life threatens to explode. He wonders if being a guy is just like being a time bomb. His own body—his own head—feels like a traitorous enemy. As Arty and Larissa find themselves betrayed by their own feelings and torn apart by circumstance. What will this mean to their group of friends? Who can he trust? Will Larissa ever be the same—and can Arty ever feel the same about her again?

<TITLE>Rules of Nature</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is a Stealth / Destruction game / tech demo. The goal is to reach the crown at the top, by evading guards and using the swords you find along the way to smash a path through to the end. Broken walls may obstruct your enemies, but be careful not to smash a staircase you need to progress :D In the middle of some major bugfixes, sorry. Known Issues: Some stairways break weirdly. Some guards jitter. Lag spike every five seconds [this is due to unoptimized pathfinding code.] The game is ugly as sin. That's the next planned update.

<TITLE>Slow play rules for F.I.S.T</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Hopefully this makes it more approachable to games with longer exploration and shorter sessions. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Slow Play Rules is an optional change for FIST to encourage longer missions. The PDF is two pages, one of which is bare text and the other is the FIST compatability logo. Everything is straightforward and easy to read. Slow Play's core changes are pretty comprehensive, covering everything from War Dice to item uses and ability uses. They're also written in such a way as to play well with other add-ons, so using Slow Play won't invalidate other expansions. Overall, if you want FIST missions to feel a little more like a full session of a more conventional ttrpg, I'd give Slow Play a look. It's quick, direct, and comprehensive.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Rules of the Road (Demo)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS Drive around the big city in order to complete various jobs in a hurry, but if you break the rules of the road it will cost you your time. In the Rules Of The Road demo you will drive around in search of the big cartoon box which is located somewhere in the city. You have 5 minutes to reach the box so you will need to balance speeding through the streets and following the driving laws (stopping for 3+ seconds at stop signs and not driving on sidewalks). Have fun! Post Demo Reflection: The demo I created is representative of the core game loop I wanted as I was able to create an environment where you drive around, following the driving laws. Overall, the demo is not really fun because the implemented laws (and the behavior if your break them) inhibit the player from doing anything that could bring thrill (speeding around the map). If I could change the demo I would make it so there is a three-strike system where you are able to break three driving laws before getting sent back to the start of the map. Having this system would allow the main game loop to still exist in the demo while giving the player the opportunity to have some fun. If I were to keep working on this project I would implement more driving laws like stop lights, speed limits, cross walks, create a better system for balancing breaking laws and following them (can't break laws where cops are nearby), and I would tune-up the driving mechanics to make it more arcade to allow for drifting.

<TITLE>Rules and Instructions</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable Game Demo for Windows This is the demo for Rules and Instructions, a short visual novel/adventure game where you play as a newly hired custodian on the night shift at the local zoo. To better demonstrate the scope of the game, the demo puts you in the role of the position's previous occupant as they complete their final night of work. The demo streamlines some of the exploration, puzzle-solving, and time-management aspects of the game so that new players can be better introduced to the game's setting. The demo has some easter eggs for those prone to exploring, but nothing too spectacular. There are two primary endings, one of which has minor variations depending on the actions taken by the player. This demo is still in development, and will likely have an expanded version in the near future. The game runs on a custom-made engine, tentatively named ScarletCore, powered by C and SDL2, and uses entirely original assets. The engine (in development) is open source, and available at https://github.com/tstwizby/ScarletCore/tree/master . Full credits are provided in the file credits-full.txt Currently, the demo is only available for Windows, but I intend to make a Linux version as well eventually. I have the ability to make a Mac version, but not to distribute it effectively unfortunately due to Apple's policies. If you encounter any problems running the game, please let me know and I will do my best to help.

<TITLE>T.W.O. RPG - 1 RULES</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Here is a set of rules I came up with in an effort to remove all reference to the OGL 1.0a and any content that falls under it. I have a problem with rules so bloated that no one can figure out what anything means without a ouija board. I also dislike rules that are so âliteâ that they leave out important parts that are required to make the game playable. T.W.O. RPG is intended to be a âliteâ yet complete set of rules. This is just the Rules. Here are additional sections: Wealth Weapons Equipment , Monsters & Traps , and Spells & Magic Items . What is the 2d10 system you ask? It is intended to replace the 1d20 used commonly in some RPG systems. I think the big advantage of using 2d10 instead of 1d20 is that the roll results in a âbell curveâ with most of the results in the center, and fewer at the outliers — in other words it is more likely that you roll a result that will be in the 'middle' and less likely to be very high or very low. This does create some changes that should be considered by the GM. This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android Welcome to the Literature Club! It's always been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love. Now that you're a club member, you can help me make that dream come true in this cute game!

That's me! I'm super excited for you to make friends with everyone and help the Literature Club become a more intimate place for all my members. But I can tell already that you're a sweetheart—will you promise to spend the most time with me? â¥ We are not affiliated with Team Salvato. This was developed by KeatonGamer1248. Looking for the original game? You can find it here . Made with GB Studio. Original Artwork by: MattWasabii Go check him out! 1. You will need an emulator or the Hardware. 2. the rom, flash cart or the cartridge 3. You are ready to play it. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Esta en espaÃ±ol? Are you able to host the project files for others willing to continue this? I think I lost the project files for it, or they're just on an old hard drive. I've hit accidentally "continue" the first time I opened the game on my Miyoo mini+ and now I'm stuck on this screen I've tried to push all the button but nothing worked I know what you have to do The file does not come inside a folder so you need to make one and out the game file into it then when inside a gba emulator press use in folder then it should load the game. I hope this helps :> hey. can you help me? when I Open the.gb File in visualboyadvance and I click on new game, i have the message no game data found I think it's because you pressed the wrong button or something. I haven't worked on the game for quite some time so I'm not really sure. I have the same issue . I accidentally pressed "continue" the first time I booted the game and it has been stuck on that message since then Did you make like any sprites for it i could reuse? id gladly continue this UPDATE: I kind of gave up on this game because of GB Studio's hardware limitations... Oh man, It's been a year since I was trying to work on this, I don't want to do what OMOCAT did... it does not let you play on android. I tried and it took me to Ibis Paint X. You need an emulator, like My OldBoy! The game is still in development, by the way. (Edit 8/31/2024: It's cancelled. I don't feel like working on this anymore.) Hey 8/31/2024 was my 16th birthday Hello 4 years later to tell you you need to put the game into a folder then it should work Playing on a flash cart and it stops after a few sentences. I understand this is still in development - I'm just wondering if there's more that just isn't showing up for some reason, or if I've actually seen all there is so far? Same for emulator, so i think it's just all you've seen so far. Actually, this what you've seen so far. I still want to work on this, but I almost feel like if I work on this, and I take too long, then everyone will get mad at me. I really don't want to pull off a Yandere Dev.ð it's okay man, games take time to make.. ik this is from 239 days ago but still worst of all it stops at the first scene Remember, this thing is in development... so you can't expect for me to make the whole game. Also Team Salvato spent 2 years working on Doki Doki Literature Club. So... It might take me a while. is it fine if I wait till it comes? Yes, but it might take a while... Since I am not working on the game right now. Also this game is for the Gameboy and emulators. :( I only have PC Do you have VisualBoy Advance on your computer? You can download VisualBoy Advance here ! it keeps saying no game data found This is actually still in progress. So, you might encounter errors.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Doki Doki Gravity Dive$7.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable SHMUP for Windows and Linux Doki Doki Gravity Dive is a Score Attack Shoot 'em Up with tiny solar systems as your playground which are populated with tiny worlds and a singularity at their center. Enemies relentlessly invade and it is up to you to keep them at bay. At least for as long as you can! Each celestial body has its own gravitational pull and to stand even the slightest chance to survive the never ending onslaught, you have to adapt to changes in gravity quickly and throw concepts like up and down out the window! So hop, fly, dodge, shoot and (hopefully) have fun! ...until the heat death of the universe. Inspiration Doki Doki Gravity Dive was inspired by games like Geometry Wars, Devil Daggers and the gravitysystem of Super Mario Galaxy. The visual style was inspired by both TRON, StarFox and 1980s CGI and chosen to be deliberately simple and as easy to read as possible considering the otherwise chaotic nature of the gameplay. Features In order to download this SHMUP you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $7.99 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Doki Doki Love Stomp</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows It's the first and last update to Love Stomp!!! Get ready for Love Stomp 1.11: You Can (Not) Stomp! 3/1 EDIT: Reuploaded to fix a stupid oversight that is kind of hilarious in retrospect, actually, but ultimately not good to keep around. If you've already downloaded 1.2, please re-download it! Sorry for the inconvenience. 3/3 EDIT: Fixed an achievements-related bug. What's new, you ask?! -Achievements! -Minor bugs fixed! -Improved the text entry recognition! -More art assets! -Brand new ULTRA ROUTE! -Secret bonus material from our talented friend Quakerin! Disclaimer: this is actually version 1.2. The name is a joke, you see. NOTE: The ULTRA ROUTE is unlocked by finishing the other four endings. If you've played the first version and you just want to see the new ULTRA ROUTE, please check the read me file for instructions. A ridiculous wrestling dating sim! Play as Hulku-chan, a young Hogan-obsessed freshman attending Wrestling School. On her way to her first class on her first day, she runs into a mysterious, 8-foot-tall sophomore named Bully Demise and begins a journey of love, stomps, and heartbreak. You can watch SGF's Valentine's stream of the game on YouTube. And the critics are raving: This is a fan work made by Lumi ( bird-robot.com ) and Koko ( kokoronis.tumblr.com ). SGF was not involved in the making of this game and is not associated with it in any way, aside from being the inspiration. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. You are insane and I love you. does auto forward time not work? Playing through this was fantastic! Both the dialog and the art were fantastic. Specially super-happy with the Felicia ending :3 Thanks for putting this out, and I look forward to whatever you do in the future! Hey, thanks! Glad you enjoyed it. Great game! Lots of laughs the whole way through! I'm looking forward to more of you guys' jokes and heart! Man, I want like most of the portraits in this game as stickers on facebook. I would use them all the time. Especially Bully going "Ok." any way to add an auto text advance option in future updates? I loved your game on sgfs stream I'm pretty sure this is an option in ren'py so I'd love to add that as an accessibility option! I think it just requires a little speed configuration to get things to work. Pretty sure that's a default in renpy, but doesn't look like there's a dedicated hotkey for it and thus it needs some kind of icon to click. Will the game receive continued development? More art assets/music/VA/etc? Ideally, we would like to include new illustrations and a few additional scenes if there is future development, as well as the addition of some easter eggs. Most of these being ideas that were scrapped as the development window closed. Honestly, we're really overwhelmed with the response to this thing! I initially thought it would just be a fun little Valentine's stream game for SGF, and not necessarily even released publicly. But since people seem to like it and want a "deluxe" version so to speak, we're seriously considering it. It's a pretty strong possibility that there will be some kind of update. I can't say how extensive of an update yet, but... probably something, yes! There was a lot we had to cut due to lack of time. To you + Koko above: That really sounds awesome! Deadlines really are the bane of development when you have to cut things, but they're also helpful in making sure that it does get done. I definitely look forwards to seeing what you add if/when the Deluxe version comes! Oh, and is there a place I can go to throw a few dollars your guys' way? we've been paid enough........... in smiles............ B] Well, have another! :D Just so you know, the main LoveStomp.exe ends up with 1 (presumably false) positive on Virus Total. If you care you could email the people who make that virus scanner about it. ( Jiangmin Trojan.Heur.aom https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/4535aa2732403ada9d8a09032836d8fc4920407758b5a6bac5557fca36c1b2e9/analysis/1455423758/ ) Thanks for the head's up! I imagine it's because it's a relatively new "program" so there's no reputation for the scanner to make an assessment off of, so it assumes the worst. heuristics basically guess whether or not something is malicious based on what the program does, false positives are pretty common This report might help you see what the antivirus thinks is suspicious, though obviously this is from an entirely different company: https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/4535aa2732403ada9d8a09032836d8fc4920407758b5a6bac5557fca36c1b2e9?environmentId=4 get your daily dose of SWORD OIL</TEXT>

Fortunately telemarketers can offer pretty much everything. Currently 4 endings with 2 more programmed but Im a perfecionist so those are unnacessible for now. More may come. Kind of gave up on GUI, I will never be good at this â¨ about the artist â¨ Im glithch and I love procrastinating by making games and then procrastinating on making those games. art blog ig Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. 10/10 i love it. but i wanna date sam the mailman Au, finally saw it again. I enjoyed this and seriously hahaha it was hilarious and the plot is good too. Hope to see more development. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. The characters are hot, even the MC is hot! The plot is so good, I cried! 10/10, would reccomend and would play again! Seriously though, I enjoyed it! ( Â´ Ï ` ) I love this!!! but got a say the squiggle has to be the hottest thing I have ever seen 11/10 dating sim this game made me lose my shit so much,, the dialogue is hilarious when its sarcastic and is able to make me really like the characters!!! I love this game sm wha.... pretty cute but for some reason with the poetic guy i always have de bad ending, i have read by a comment that was posted before that it was some kind of error of the coding so i hope that would get fixed, besudes that i really liked the game :) This was so good, Protag gives me life and is life 10/10 Will we be seeing more of Susan , Patrick and Debora honestly they are my favorite characters idk if youre going to respond but like the poetic dude ending is very confusing. Idk if it is a glitch in my system but whenever i play his route(no choices) I automatically get the very bad end and it goes to the squiggly line dialogue and I was wondering if that was apart of the comedic effect or it is a actual defect :) Everything else was amazing though I was actually having the same issue as well, so I decided to go looking through the script to see what was the matter. It turns out that the squiggly man dialogue is part of something else and that it jumped to that dialogue due to not having anywhere else to go. After the line "You look at the notes in your hand and finally understand," it seems that there was suppose to be a choice of whether or not you thought the poetry was great or not, but one wasn't there even though there was code programmed for after you chose. Since I have some experience in Ren'Py, I was able to code in the choice and attach it to the already programmed scenes they were supposed to lead to. After that I was able to get the ending to make sense and even looked at old videos of people playing through the game to comfirm that I attached the choices to the right scenes. can you explain how to do this? i'd like to see the normal ending! I don't know how to explain how do it exactly, but I can send you the one file I had to edit to fix the issue and have you replace the original one with my edited one. I sign up just to leave a comment here because god. It's so good. My fav is White Guy,the background music fit him so well....and the ending,so sad and fulled of emotions...I love it. All the part of the game is GREAT. The music,humour,vibe....I'm dying for this game and I would kill for more ;_; I think I'm gonna make some fanart hjhjkhjkhjkhkhk monster: whos the monster now!!! >:( me: still you god i am SO THIRSTY for the rich guy. dumb princes and flamboyant flirts have always been my type!!! this is so cute and good and i love it! Ahhhh we are the same then!! i Made this game completely for my own tastes and prince boy is a big fave :^)) !! he truly is senpai material This is so amazing. I hope with all my heart you ARE planning on finishing this omg. I especially love the monster. Well, that was underpriced and I think I'm gonna draw some fanart now thank you so much! you have no idea how much that means to me <3 currently im stumped with new college (dont even have time to upload to instagram) but i really wish to one day finish this properly. i was a bit too ambitious for my skillset at the timr but i still love what i had planned for this! hoOOOOLLLLLD ON?!!?!?!? HOW DO YOU GET SUCH ROUTE?!!!??!!? the mailman route is actually unfinished and it was supposed to be a feature in the full version <\3 Oh gosh this is so funnY AND CUTE AHAHAHHAHAAHAHHA I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH OWWJeoretkgmerAAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAOHMYFUCKINGGODAJEFUJE Cat Love ending was my favorite uwu! oh my god!!!!!! thank you SO. much Wowza this game is really really fun, humour is greAT. I am making a visual novel of my own and yours has been an inspiration! I hope you keep going with this game! (I was reading through your script like a high grade black hat hacker, just to see how you programmed certain things in!! For educational purposes i promise, I hope it is okay.) I wanna draw fanart for this!! Should i tag you on Tumblr? your characters are really funny. thank you for making this game! i ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. wow thank you so much! its so fun to get these comments from time to time <3 yes yes! tag me @glithchgames or on ig @glithchdraws you have no idea how sweet this is <3 I was in a really bad mood today and I thought that this was going to be the best game to play to clear up the clouds, and honestly? I was right. Loved all the boys, loved this indirect shit talking of other stereotypical dating sims by using these tropes ( I kind of linked the Edgy Poet with Nageki from Hatoful Boyfriend because of the death thing, but who knows -- ), though I'm kinda salty because I -- I don't know how to find the fourth end. Weeps forever,, In any case, still love the game & my favorite boy is probably Rich Guy, hahh!! Keep up the good work <33 everytime i check out this page i notice a very old comment i never got a notification for and i know i have to reply because all of these make me so happy asdfg. so very late but thank you! ((rich guy is also my fav)) ok i really like this game! i got the rose ending, the cat love ending, and the introvert (same) ending. but i cant seem to get the last one. anything to trigger it? <3 this was honestly such a great game, it made me smile and also choke on the cashews i was eating, which woke my sister up who wasn't very happy to come into my room to see me playing games at 3am. protag was actually so relatable ?? like,, omg thanks for making this game it's honestly one of my favorites oh gosh!!! this is so motivational actually <33 ty! It was so cute and funny! it's really cute and for some reason funny seeing as i choked on my water ???? LMAO but anyways, you stated there were 4 endings but I've only gotten 3 so highkey confused plus triggered cuz im a game perfectionist :(( ahhhhhhhh. im so glad! the 4 ending is kind of a trolley ending and happens when something goes wrong lmao Thank you for asking us to play your game! We had a lot of fun, and the humor was great! Can't wait to see if you add more to it later on! Really nice game! aaaah! thank you <3 Hi ^_^ So I finally checked your game out and even edit the first part of let's play on it. SOOOOO... Not my ordinary cup of tea, I be honest, cause I like something more dynamic. Even though I pretty liked it. ESPECIALLY Sam's and our POET guy routes. THE POET WAS SOO COOL, I liked kind of suspense in that storyline. Nice ^_^ And the ending. Yeah... my inner teenage emo kid was so pleased xD The whole atmosphere and idea of this game is pretty cute. Though I just wanted to quickly ask one thing about lgbt theme. Is it there only because our main character is of unknown gender? I'm kind of confused there xD Aaaanyway, I would love to see the end result. Good luck, and I wish your inspiration will never leave your side ^_^ awww thank you for lovely gameplay im going to watch it whole in a second :D and yeah LGBT themes are there as i didnt really want to mess around with coding a choice for the player to be either a girl, boy or non binary (and i think that would kind of mess up the tempo) so i tried going the route of unspecified gender. okay then :) and ehm.... sorry? xD and considering the ending with the mailman. looks like you downloaded the version of the game before i updated the file so that route was unaccessible for now. dang too bad since its unfinished</TEXT>

<TITLE>Doki Doki No Obama</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS Created for the 2014 Indie Game Maker Contest, Doki Doki No Obama was my attempt to try and rationalize the whole Net Neutrality nightmare, learn some Python, and try and make a game that was both a political satire of the situation while also being a fun comedy/dating sim. It was an adventure, having to learn enough python to make it work, put a game together, and also research some of these key figures... but I did it! With some help from my friend Andrew we managed to get submitted with literal minutes to spare in the contest deadline. After a couple years of not being hosted anywhere when the context website went down, it's now home on Itch.io! Anyway, I hope you have fun.

Play in fullscreen for the best experience Commands: About Made by Andrea Montagna ( @fullmontis ) for the LD44 compo in 48 hours. Check out my other games ! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. This is some of the most funny little games I played this year, I'm happy the "assets" shown as the thumbnail of https://fullmontis.itch.io/super-pinup-smasher-2000 got me to check out your page and find this. The concept is freaking hilarious and genuinely fun to play (though unsure if I like the heartbeat-rate being restrictive, though that's just me loving to shmove around). And on top of that is some fun character-design and some really neat sound-effects. There's two things I would recommend to keep in mind for future games (I thought I had more but I can't remember them right now): 1. Give your character some maximum fall speed. Unlimited fallspeed is pretty much always unwanted (though in this case it might end up messing with shooting yourself down, so I might've also not bothered with trying to find a workaround for that in a jam setting) Happy that you like it! And sure, you can play around with the concept if you want I think I didn't put any limits mostly because I wanted the player to have control over the top speed they can reach This is a really cute idea, I love the art style and the overall concept. It was a lot of fun to finish! I feel like with some more polish, you could have a really great game on your hands! Thank you for playing! I know it's entirely pointless to point out bugs to this, nor do I expect them to be fixed, but they do somewhat undermine the game's difficulty. Fun diversion besides that though. The only way I could lose was being attacked by an enemy. I can shoot until 219 BPM. When I shoot once more, it gets kicked backwards to 217 BPM where it just stays regardless of shooting more. Spacebar combines both Z and X commands at once, which seems unintended. Thanks for pointing these out! That was an Enjoyable little game :) I really liked the character! Thanks! This Game's Awesome Glad you liked it! Such a simple, yet awesome game. Love it <3 Thank you! Happy you liked it! Awesome Game! Simple,Cute & Fun to play game!:D I Hope You don't mind if I upload my gameplay of the game in my Youtube channel. I want to share it with my friend and everyone! Thank You! Good Job! Keep Up the Good Work! :3 I don't mind at all, thanks for the video! "That was a BLAST!!" This is cute, Ali's characterization gives it so much good energy. great concept, although I dont think you have the controls quite down yet. maybe incorporate the mouse in some way. still awesome so far! keep it up! <3 Dayuum, that is tough! Nice video with black screen and exciting music! :) (HTML5 Win version plays only music with black screen) (I guess it is a "mus/crazy.ogg" playing) I clicked different buttons several times but nothing happen. Try reloading the page, it does it for me sometimes, I don't know why though. Reinstalled the game, left it for an hour or more (just waited), closed and opened again but nothing changed. I can't help you about Godot but I want to, really. Wait, you're talking about the web version? In that case you should just download the Windows Desktop version from the downloads, that should work (I tested it). Oh, I guess there are some misunderstanding between us. Let me show you. In the very beginning you can find download buttons for different platforms. After clicking at Windows version I can see such situation (screenshot). There are 2 files I can download. If I load 1st file and try to open the game, the directory of the game is opened and nothing happen. If I download 2nd file, there is Web version with black screen and music. And as you can see under "Rocket jump and make thinks go boom" (screenshot) there is "ÐÐ³ÑÐ°" ("Game"). And there I can't find an icon of Windows. Apple, Linux, HTML5 but no Windows. Maybe I can't find something but I guess I did everything correct. Ah crap, you're right, I'm sorry! I forgot to add the check for the window version. Try it now, it should work.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Doki Doki Dollmaker$20</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Doki Doki Dollmaker is a boys love (BL or BxB) visual novel. Make decisions on behalf of Lyle to steer the story in different directions and experience multiple endings. The full game is now available for purchase exclusively on Itch.io along with a free extended demo for Windows, Linux, and Mac! â¥ Nothing lasts forever â at least, thatâs what young Lyle has come to believe. Forced to move away from home with his older brother, Lyle finds himself in a new town, far away from a painful past and heading toward a lonely future. When he finds comfort in making dolls using a mysterious sewing kit, he soon discovers that his life will be anything but lonely! Be immersed in this heartfelt tale of love and discover what it means to find yourself, no matter who, or what, is willing to lend a hand! Lyle (the player-character) must move away with his older brother Cole after the sudden and unfortunate passing of their parents. To occupy his mind during the long road trip to their new home, Lyle makes five plush dolls using some leftover materials found in an old sewing kit. Due to the magical properties of the sewing kit and Lyle's cry for help (brought about by loss, unfamiliarity, and bullying at school), the dolls come to life! The narrative focuses around Lyle and his relationship with the five dolls. He has a lot to teach them, but thereâs a lot he can learn from them too. This heartfelt love story is also a coming-of-age story with several overarching plots; Lyle must adapt to his new environment, cope with loss, strengthen his relationship with his brother, discover his sexual orientation, and overcome gender stereotypes, all while teaching five curious dolls about the world. His relationship with the dolls is a complicated one. After all, he plays multiple roles: creator, teacher, and companion. He wasnât planning to add âboyfriendâ to that list, but who knows! Will it be love at first stitch? Could Lyle fall in love with one of these dolls turned human? It's up to you! The choices you make will affect the outcome of the story and unlock beautiful CG images along the way!

Email dokidokidollmaker@gmail.com for specific concerns or inquiries. Thank you! â¥ In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $20 USD.

I love this game so much, I cried and laughed and the twist at the end got me good and I was taken aback in a good way. I'm glad I play it on Twitch and the game had a good storyline and loveable characters. I love this game so much! I cried and laughed, and the twist at the end surprised me in a good way. I'm glad I played it on Twitch, as the game features a great storyline and lovable characters. Hi Yasmeen.Owens, Thank you so much for the rating/review - your feedback means the world to indie game developers like myself! Iâm so glad you enjoyed the story and its colorful characters. ð Please let me know if you play it again on Twitch - Iâd be happy to hop into chat the next time you stream Doki Doki Dollmaker! Sincerely, Karitsa ð Will do Will there be translations into other languages? I'm Brazilian and I would love to play but it's a bit difficult to translate and read the story at the same time. Hello Protagonista, Unfortunately, there are no official translations at this time. With enough interest, it might be possible in the future. ð Thank you so much for your interest and support! Karitsa Well, I'm a Brazilian translator, and if you're ever interested in translating into Portuguese, I would be very happy to make that happen! (love your game btw <3) Thanks for reaching out, ohmygothy! (And thanks for loving the game <33) Please feel free to email your rates to: dokidokidollmaker@gmail.com in case we're able to make it happen down the road! Karitsa I would love for this game to be on steam, with achievements. I'd love to purchase and play it. Hi Zakaries! A steam release is being considered. Feel free to follow the project here on Itch.io and on X/Twitter @DokiDollmaker to be notified of any future releases. Thanks so much for your interest! Karitsa i did this thinking of a pet worm i had as a child and its real now and its eating my bed. what do i do i just wanted to snuggle my pet worm help? Hi wormaniel, Iâm no expert on the subject, but you should still be able to snuggle your pet worm even if itâs eating your bed - just snuggle with it on the floor after the bed has been consumed. Hope this helps and yâall are able to enjoy the game comfortably together. ð Karitsa (Note: I am not a reviewer so take this a grain of salt ð ) (Also don't worry, no spoilers). I saw this game a while ago but couldn't purchase it at the time, fast forward when it was on sale & I just immediately bought it right then! Great concept for a game, however, it's kinda bland(?) in execution. I'll explain but first lemme say the positives. The CGs and all other art are fantastic, no complaints here. I also love a BL where the sibling isn't a love interest LOL, and there's a female friend, YAY! I think the Full Group ending is the best ð, I feels like it would be canonical (morbidly I like the Worst ending because OMFG)! The twist that had to do with the main character was a nice surprise too. That brings me to the story... the main one that doesn't have to do with the love interests themselves isn't that bad, I like a person dealing with grief going to a new place where weird things start happening. But to me, especially when it comes to the dolls, it feels incomplete, like both the "heart events" and the main plot have nothing to do with each other. I feel from an objective standpoint, it's not laired enough. Maybe it's a pacing issue, I'm not quite sure. Other nitpicks are all I think some of the character designs try way too hard to be unique (even if the art itself is lovely as I've said), this includes the names too (I laughed at Kyle with an "L" ð). But that's especially subject of me so ð¤·ââï¸ Overall, I don't regret buying Doki Doki Dollmaker (great name btw). Though you should def play the demo version beforehand, if you liked it, I'd said check it out! But if not, I don't think you'll be missing anything crazy. Thanks for creating this game and thank YOU for reading! ð Hi yoslina102! Thanks for playing Doki Doki Dollmaker and for leaving a spoiler-free comment/review - it means a lot to solo developers like me! So glad you enjoyed the art; both Dejinyucu and bemicat worked exceptionally hard on the various pieces and they really bring the characters to life. So happy you appreciate Cole and Tilly as well; we love our not-so-minor characters! I also consider the Full Group good ending to be canon, so yes, you are correct. â¥ï¸ (A friend of mine surprisingly likes the worst ending too, so you're not alone, haha!) I'm not sure what changes I could have made to the story or pacing to make it feel more layered, but appreciate your feedback and am glad you still enjoyed the experience enough for multiple playthroughs. As for the character designs, particularly the dolls, they are over-the-top to create contrast between them and the human characters; I didn't want them to look like they came from or belonged in Lyle's world. Also, I just happen to like bright/fun designs and they felt like a good fit for the game's handmade/patchwork theming. Their epilogue sprites, which have regular clothing, help to tone things down a bit! (For the record, I think "Kahvel" is a stranger name than "Lyle," haha!) Thank you again for playing and for sharing your thoughts! Karitsa I just got the game, I can't wait to play (I predict Torin is gonna be my fav but we'll see)! Hi yoslina102! Thank you so much for purchasing my visual novel! ð Please consider leaving a rating/review for the game when youâre finished - I would love to hear your thoughts and it really helps the project out. Torin is a great pick - I hope he makes you smile! Karitsa is it nsfw? Only the (optional) epilogues! Hi caroljudoca, It is being considered, but nothing is confirmed yet. Be sure to follow the project for any future announcements - thanks for your interest! Karitsa This looks so fun...but I have an android AND I can't buy it...will there be a free and android version in the future? ð¥º Hi AlecNightfal, There are no plans for an android release in the future. Feel free to follow the project to be notified of sales/discounts. Thank you for your interest! Karitsa Spoilers AHEAD!!! While I absolutely loved the game with every fiber of me being, from the art, character design, their personalities, the way the story unfolded, and more, something left me feeling a bit...I'm not sure how to put it, dissatisfied might not be the right word but it is the closest one. I just finished my first route, Desifer's, and while I understand the reasoning behind only being able to save him at the end, the way that after the hospital part where Lyle asks "Where are they ?" The fact that the rest of the dolls proceeded to be ignored afterwards, with only Desifer being acknowledged at all, made me just really sad and confused. Lyle didn't feel sad or guilty about not being able to give the others a life too, he didn't say goodbye to them or thank them for their time together, he acted like they never existed at all. It felt really weird reading that part and I honestly could not completely enjoy the ending scene as much; considering I was spending time being confused as to why the other dolls were not being talked about. Again, I understand in that situation that only Desifer could be saved, but I would've like a bit of acknowledgment for the other dolls who were Lyle's friends during the worst part of his depression after his parents passed away. I know they were briefly mentioned in the epilogue, but felt more like an after thought than anything. It also made me sad knowing they were being kept by Tilly in her room. Why not with Lyle? I don't know, sorry for ranting about this weird pet peeve I had. Do not let this make you feel like I didn't love the game tho, it made me feel so many amazing emotions and it definitely left a mark on me. I'm really glad to be playing it. I will soon be playing the other routes including the group ending, but I just wanted to let these feelings out while they were fresh. This is an amazing game, thank you for making it! â¥ Hi Ducksrock! Thank you so much for playing Doki Doki Dollmaker and sharing your feedback! If you (or any other players) are interested in knowing the reasoning behind some of the writing decisions that were made, Iâd be happy to share my thought process with you. Spoilers ahead, of course!! . . . . . . . . . . Iâm sorry your experience with the solo route did not end as anticipated, but I am confident that the full group good ending will meet your expectations! The full group good ending is the TRUE ending, with the potential for Lyle to end up with any (or all) of the dolls after the events of the story. The passage of time between scenes in Doki Doki Dollmaker is not always clear, which is common in the âslice-of-lifeâ genre. Weeks, months, or even a year could have passed between Lyle leaving Mr. Mendozaâs shop and having his private scene with the individual doll (in Desiferâs case, the scene where Lyle is made late for school). When the epilogue screen finally appears, where the dolls are pictured on the desk as Lyle reminisces, it is meant to show not only that Lyle still thinks of the other four dolls, but that he misses them, too - after all, he still talks to them even though they are gone. To me, Lyle continuing to meet with them as time passes is his guilt. I imagine the dolls are at Tillyâs house because Lyle canât bear to see them sitting on his desk, knowing that he could never give them the life they deserved or repay them for their friendship, but players can interpret this however they choose, since it is not explicitly stated. I hope my perspective was an interesting read. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts - I appreciate your detailed comment and hope to hear from you again in the future! Karitsa Compre el juego ayer, y es una maravilla. Me encantan las novelas visuales, por suerte entiendo muy bien el ingles, y se nota el cariÃ±o y amor que le pusieron a este juegoâ¥ Tienen un nuevo seguiro :D Por cierto, amo a Rookâ¥ Â¡Hola! Google Translate me estÃ¡ ayudando a escribir en espaÃ±ol. Â¡Gracias por jugar a Doki Doki Dollmaker! Me alegra mucho que disfrutes la historia. Â¡Espero que Rook te haga sonreÃ­r! Gracias por sus amables palabras. ðð Karitsa hi. I was looking for blind-friendly vns and found this one with the tag on it. Does it have self-voicing support, is it completable with keyboard and does it have alt text for images? Hi gamer824, Yes, Doki Doki Dollmaker is blind/visually-impaired friendly! The following alternative text will be read aloud when self-voicing is enabled by pressing âvâ on your keyboard during gameplay: Donât hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions! Happy playing! ð Karitsa Oh, and yes, it is compatible with keyboard! You can use the arrow keys to navigate the menus and choices, and if self-voicing is enabled, the option will be read. Hope this helps! Steam... plz, I'm begging you. Itâs being considered! ð Thanks for your interest, Trampampam! I havenât played this yet… short on money at the moment, but Iâm glad I found this so I can get later. I was curious though. Have you considered making actual plushies of those dolls? Cause they are super cute Hi Cassirole, Thanks for your interest in Doki Doki Dollmaker! I hope you'll be able to pick it up in the future. It goes on sale occasionally, so follow the project on social media to be notified when there's a discount! I actually commissioned some plush keychains a looooong time ago (when Rook's hair was still dark red lol), but I couldn't remember who made them, so I never shared photos online. If I ever find the artist's name again, I'll be sure to post pics! (Maybe I can post the pics to help find the crafter? Hmm...) It'd be nice to sell some official "life-sized" plushies someday, though! I'll dream about that for a little while!! â¥ Karitsa I'd been following this project silently on and off on Lemmasoft for a few years already, and I bought it the moment I saw it was out. I didn't actually get a chance to read through it until this weekend, however... It's annoying when life gets in the way of fun things :c I (finally) got around to reading it, though, and I enjoyed it a lot! I decided to go with Desifer, because he is the prettiest (and he is shirtless more often than not, which is a bonus lol), and I really enjoyed it! I like that, though the premise of the story is a bit 'out there', it's actually very grounded. Lyle's depression after his parents' deaths is treated with a lot of importance, and isn't brushed to one side, and I like how his relationship with Cole was expanded upon too. Cole's such a sweet older brother; he's trying so hard for Lyle! Very moe >_< It was interesting how the story treated the dolls, too. Lyle's internal debates about just how 'human' they were felt pretty realistic (I mean, as realistic as a blatantly unrealistic scenario like this can be haha), and it was pretty cute seeing him wonder about the anatomy of the dolls too. I thought it'd lean more into cute slice of life stuff, and it did in the beginning, but the last 1/4 or so of the story was pretty emotional. I think the ending twist was well done, and the romance scenes were so cute and sweet! Deji's art is absolutely gorgeous: I love how expressive and lively all the characters are (and ofc I love how Desifer's muscles are rendered owo) The CGs are very intricate, with a lot of different expressions for each, and there are so many of them! I only saw the CGs for Desifer's route, so I've only scratched the surface, but I already felt very well-fed in terms of pretty art. There's soooo much nice art in this VN, $20 really does feel like a steal. Also, the CG of Desifer and Lyle in a field with their hair braided together? Adorable. It's simply too cute for words. My heart melted, and then I died. So cute..... ;w; I'm interested in checking out the other routes (maybe Torin's: his grumpy presonality is v cute), but I liked Desifer so much I don't want to cheat on him!!! I do want to see the rest of the nice art too, though... Wah... This is the problem when multi route VNs have characters which are too lovable: it's hard to read the other routes hahaha ;;; Maybe I'll bring myself to do it eventually, though... Thank you for making this VN! It's very polished, and I can tell you put a lot of love into it. It was a well put together story with some sweet, sincere moments and some very cute characters, and I really enjoyed it! Hi ebi-hime! I apologize for the late reply. I've been meaning to respond to this post since I saw it a month ago and failed to find the words before I got caught up in some "life" things myself! Responsibilities always seem to interfere with fun, don't they? I can't thank you enough for your kind words. I'm so happy you enjoyed playing Doki Doki Dollmaker! I appreciate you following the project over its many years of development. Your enthusiasm brought a huge smile to my face - thank you for sharing your experience so thoroughly and thoughtfully! I had a feeling you'd go for Desifer first! He's understandably quite popular with players. I hope his more heartfelt scenes were a pleasant surprise for you! If you can't bring yourself to romance the other dolls because you love Desifer that much, you could always just replay his route again and again, haha! I put my all into the story and its characters and am glad it shows in the final product. I wanted to make sure my writing lived up to Deji and bemicat's amazing illustrations. I'm so grateful to have them on the team! This passion project couldn't have happened without support from team members and from players like you. Thank you. â¥ Karitsa Hello. Will there be a guide available, and if so, when please? Hi ManekiNeko, Yes, a guide will be available in the future. Iâve been busy with the art book lately and havenât gotten around to posting it, but should have something up next month! ð Karitsa Thank you very much! <3 Hello, Karitsa! I saw this game on sale and I was immediately hit with dejavu from the beautiful art style. Did you or the artist/s involved happen to also help in the creation of a fantasy dating game featuring humanoid dragons as the (two) LIs? I can't remember its name, but the thought is nagging at the back of my head. Hi Nacchan! Yes, one of Doki Doki Dollmakerâs artists, Dejinyucu, was involved with that game - itâs called Autumn's Journey! I hope youâll check both visual novels out. We love feel-good games! âºï¸ð Karitsa OMG, thank you! So that's where I'd seen it from. They do such amazing work. I'd love to take a look at your game soon too! :) Hi, do you have any plans to release this game on Steam? Hi Akino Yamiko! There are no plans to release Doki Doki Dollmaker on steam at this time, but if anything changes in the future I will be sure to let players know! Thanks for your interest! Karitsa i have gotten all the characters good endings and the bad ending but i cant figure out how to get the good ending with all of them together pls help ps. amazing game i have loved playing it all of the endings are amazing you did an incredible job 10/10 :) Thank you so much for playing and for your kind words! Thereâs a hint on this itch.io page on how to get the full group ending, but if youâre still having trouble, a game guide will be released in the future. Thank you for your patience and good luck! ðð ok thank you so much for the reply ill see if i can find it and cant wait for the guide!! :) hello! not sure if i can ask this here, but i'm having a really hard time getting the good ending with all of them ^^ is this possible to do? if so, is there a guide or instruction that could help me? :] thank you! p.s: i've been waiting for this game for like two years and it's everything i thought it'd be and more!! i love it sm, thank you for working so hard on it <3 I can give you a few pointers. hang out with the same doll throughout the story. pgup is your friend (that's the backspace in game). and trust the toy shop owner. ohhh thank you, but i meant like. the ending with *all* of them ^^ where you can end with all of them at once :] that's one of three endings that I haven't figured out yet. lol puddlewater, Iâm glad youâre enjoying the game so far and am happy that my passion for the project is shining through in the final product! ð¥ºð If youâre talking about the *full group* ending, there is a hint on this itch.io game page if you look hard enough. Otherwise, check out Loveverlyâs comment. ð Good luck! Karitsa thank you so much! i couldn't find it the first time, but i'll look for it again >:] I have my Desifer body pillow ready and can't wait to dive in! It's surreal that we're finally here!! Congratulations on the game release <3 Yaaaaay!! Give it some big hugs and enjoy! Thank you so much~ ðð§¡ Once the mature content is blocked, is there an option to allow the mature content again? just restart the game. it should ask for age verification and then if you want to see the epilogue again. DaSkillz2023, Yes, as Loveverly stated, the age verification is at the start of every new game! There is no option to block/unblock mid-play through. Thank you for asking, as Iâm sure other players will be curious about this as well! Karitsa I enjoyed this game so much! All the characters are so cute <3. I still have missing cgs after getting all my boys, and I'm excited to eventually get them all! dani4the6, Iâm so glad youâre enjoying the game and love the characters! ð¥° If youâre having trouble unlocking all of the CGs, the art book will include a small game guide in the future! Otherwise, thereâs a hint hidden on the itch.io game page~ ð Karitsa I've finished my first route (Torin) and blubbered so much while playing that my cat kept worrying about me. lol You did an excellent job Karista. I'm so glad I backed this. :) Loveverly, I'm sorry to have made you cry, but I hope some were happy tears! Your cat is doing a wonderful job looking out for you. â¥ Thank you for your kind words and for helping bring the project to life with your pledge!! Karitsa haha, no problem. I'm so glad I did cat boy's route first. :D I love Des too though. :D i remember following the progress of this game long ago and it's nice to see it finally completed!! congrats on the release and i'm looking forward to play it ðââï¸â¨ Hi miko, Thanks for following the project all this time! ð Yes, Iâm so excited to finally share Lyleâs story with everyone. I hope you enjoy your play-through(s) and get the ending(s) youâre aiming for!! Karitsa I cannot WAIT for this game. I was really excited to play through the demo, and was NOT disappointed. Everything from the music, the character designs, the dialogue - it's all so undeniably charming, you just get sucked in right away. I was not only laughing at all the jokes, but also feeling genuine concern and sympathy for the MC at times. I sat down and played through all the routes in the demo in one go, and I'm already obsessed. From what I've played, I just know that this story is going to make me cry tears of joy AND sadness. Looking forward to the full release!!! Hi xipielle, Your comment brings me so much joy - thank you for your kind words! I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the demo and are excited for the full release. We're getting very close now... less than two months away! I can't wait to share Lyle's story with you. I hope your happy tears outweigh the sad ones!! â¥ Karitsa As the lucky schmuck who's been editing the game and therefore has played the whole thing, I can *confidently* say--you aren't wrong ð. Definitely keep some kleenex handy! Um Hello May I ask is there an android version on this game it's because I love it and OH I am new to this and Iam very interested to game Iam gonna be honest I REALLY LOVE THIS SO MUCH I HOPE THERE'S AN ANDROID I CAN'T WAIT HEHE AND SORRY IT'S BECAUSE I WAS MOVE IN THIS GAME ðððððð I HOPE READ MY COMMENT AND GOOD LUCK ððð Hi Gracefeel, Doki Doki Dollmaker will be available on PC only via itch. There are no plans for a mobile/Android release in the future, but if anything changes, Iâll be sure to let players know on this itch page and on Twitter @DokiDollmaker as well. ð Thank you so much for your interest! Iâm happy that youâre excited for the project. Weâre working very hard on it! Karitsa OH I WILL THANK YOU HEHE ðððððð I am very much looking forwards to the full release of the game. I too have suffered the loss of a parent quite young and people find so many ways to cope. Mines was body art. This game has such an interesting concept, so much so that I cannot wait to sink my teeth into it. Also, I have already picked the one I wanna romance. I have a thing for redheads! I am eagerly waiting on the release! Nautinthislifetime, Thank you so much for sharing. ð Weâve been working very hard on the full release and hope to bring it to you soon. Iâm happy to hear that you like the concept and characters; your enthusiasm is greatly appreciated! âºï¸ Karitsa Hi Hi Karitsa! how is it going with 'Doki Doki Dollmaker' ? at what piont in 'progress bar' are you guys now? ;] Any concrete date for the release? (my 'fan girl heart' is little dried up and needs some sustenance ;PPP) Hi Kelsea! I appreciate your anticipation for the project! Hereâs whatâs left to be done before release (as far as programming goes): - Implement remaining CGs (as they come in) - Write five 18+ epilogues - Code and polish five 18+ epilogues - Apply editor-advised changes and corrections (as they come in) Another artist, bemicat, has joined the team to help us catch up with CG production, which we were behind on. Editing will be 60% complete by the end of next month. We donât have an official release date at this time, but will communicate it with players as soon as one becomes available! ð Karitsa thanks for letting us know^^ hang in there and thank you for all your hard work! Of course! âºï¸ Thank you for your patience and support. ð I loooove it Do you have plans to put it on steam? Hi NewVane! There are no plans to release Doki Doki Dollmaker on Steam at this time, but if anything changes in the future, Iâll be sure to communicate that with players. Thanks for your interest! ð Karitsa Cant waiiiiit Iâm glad youâre looking forward to the full release, MyKawaiiPanda! I have tried to use "Buy now" option on itch.io but it doesn't seem to work..? can you help me out and tell me what I'm doing wrong? Hi Kelsea, Youâre not doing anything wrong! The âBuy Nowâ option does not work at this time because there is nothing to buy - the commercial version of the game has not been released yet. The full version will become available next year, alongside an extended demo; I hope youâll look forward to it! Thank you for your support. ð wow... I tried the demo - it's interesting and I really hope to see the end of it :D keep up good work^^ Reminds me of the Cute Demon Crashers^^ Kelsea, Thanks for trying the demo! Iâm so happy to hear youâre excited for the full release. Feel free to follow the project on Twitter/Tumblr to stay up-to-date with the projectâs progress! Also, Doki Doki Dollmakerâs artist is the same as Cute Demon Crashers; looks like you recognized Dejinyucuâs art! ð ahh.... so that's why I though I saw Keal's and Orias' eyes in some of the characters and the general 'feel' ot them^^ I'm so happy! (I love the little game they made;))) I also makes me 'pumped up' for the one you are working on^^ I have high hopes but you don't need to feel pressured - I like the demo very much (it's good and balanced) so do your own thing and the way you see fit;]] Simply put: realise your dream version of it - it would be great^^ Sorry mates Dolls Dolls Dolls! Here's my playthrough for all to explore, Enjoy ! **You are invited to explore a BL Visual Novel like no other!** Karitsa It was a pleasure to explore (a sweet beginning) to the world of a BL Visual Novel. I loved the characters especially the way we are subjected to multiple emotions and feelings. Lyle is very personable as the Main Character; Was he gifted special abilities for his dolls or is it a curse from the 'friendly' Old toy man? The way his personal experience easily tied together a story is something most Visual Novels are lacking so super brownie points to all the details you've taken time to add and represent in your BL. Overall? Please Please Please FOLLOW SHARE and SUPPORT Karitsa in their BL Visual Novel endeavors! Links are provided RIGHT HERE! https://twitter.com/dokidollmaker https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/karitsa/doki-doki-dollmaker-a-heartfelt-bl-... Marlonplays, Thanks for checking out the demo and sharing your play through! I enjoyed watching your video; the commentary was entertaining and I caught myself laughing at many of your responses. I especially enjoyed your reaction to the dolls! Kahvel isn't often a first-choice, so it was cool to see someone gravitate toward him like you did. I sincerely appreciate your kind words about the project and would love to watch your full play through someday! I adore this game! I can't wait for the full release and I rarely ever pay for visual novels, but this is so interesting that I just have to. I mean, take my money! The character designs are so pretty and vibrant, I love how you can get an input into their personalities through the way they dress and their facial and even their facial structure. I can't wait to get to know them all. Only downside is that they are all so amazing, I don't know how I'll be able to choose. Guess, I'll playing for a long, long time then. Gotta get every boy some love! I also love how Lyle actually has personality and troubles whereas some novels make the MC really bland and 2 dimensional just to go more in-depth with the love interests. You can tell a visual novel is going to be good when they put effort into the psyche of the MC. I also like how instead of completely focusing on the love interests, the story (of what I have seen in the demo) sheds light and builds on Lyle's other relationships (Tilly, Cole) and also the dynamic between the dolls. I eagerly await the full game and any updates about it in the meantime! Amazing work! Eviepuss, I'm glad you enjoyed playing the demo and are excited to learn more about the characters! Although the story is fairly linear (with choices affecting specific scenes, dialogue, and endings), I'm sure the unique moments with each doll will make your repeat-plays equally enjoyable! If you've fallen for all five dolls, you may want to aim for the "full group" good ending - it's difficult to obtain, but the bonus scene is worth it. Thank you for your kind words about Lyle's character and the story. Doki Doki Dollmaker is romance-focused, but it's also a coming-of-age story. Lyle is trying to adapt to his new environment, cope with loss, and learn about himself as he enters a new stage in his life. You will find that his relationships with Cole, Tilly, and Mr. Mendoza can be just as important to his growth as his relationship with the dolls. I'm happy to hear that these aspects of the story are a welcome addition to the script! Thanks again for your lovely comment and support! I played the Demo and am very excited to play the full game when it comes out! the visuals are amazing, the style of each character is perfect, with so many expressions and lovely dialogue! I recorded myself playing the demo and I gush over just how much I love it. Proud to say I am backing this project on kickstarter! Faelel, Thanks for downloading the demo and sharing your play through! I already mentioned this on Twitter, but I laughed every time you lovingly scolded Lyle, calling him "child" - too cute! I appreciate you sharing your video here on itch as well for those who might have missed it. Happy to have you as a backer on Kickstarter and looking forward to seeing more videos in the future - thanks for your support!</TEXT>

<TITLE>A Story Of Ideas</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS A game about games..... A meta-narrative centered around examining sketches, ideas, half-baked maybe. The original inception for this work lies within putting together a list of all the topics I have explored so far in projects across my Masterâs, this was done as part of a brainstorming of ideas. I discovered through this, that when compiled together, my history of projects showed insight into myself. This instigated a reflection of my thought processes in an interesting way. The most interesting question at the heart of this project, will be how games and/or elements of games are or are not, an interesting reflection of their developer, especially within independent games. In addition to this we can ask, what does identity in games help us to see and understand about the creative process itself. What can be learned from the history of a developer through their works, both successful and unsuccessful. This question will be used as the backbone of the project and accompanying thesis, a project that will explore and examine my own works. The linear narrative of this game will do this while utilising meta-fictional techniques, highlighting the creative process, and cross-examining, reflecting on my own works. To be played at it's native 1920 Ã 1080 Resolution. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Sunset IV</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game A message from GCJ Entertainment 1985 With the boom in arcade machines in the past few years, many less popular games have a small shelf life and are quickly being replaced. These games have a risk of being lost to history. To combat this, now in 1985 G.C.J. Entertainment has decided to port four poorly received arcade games into a single cabinet, to be archived in computer museums around the world. This is what we call Operation Sunset IV. Please enjoy this slice of history. Since this is a port for a modern web browser, we had to map the original arcade controls to work with a computer keyboard. This game was made by Alex Tritt for the #NoticeMe game jam 2022. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hmm, interesting! You could do more with the blue-haired girl from the visual novel section (I forgot her name immediately)'s appearance in other games reflect her origin (such as her being confused about Super Cat Bruh or trying to talk down the vehicles in the other two games), I saw that as a wasted opportunity. Thanks for the advice - honestly this game (or 4) was way too much work to even just get to a MVP during the jam time, so I'm pretty keen to remake it at some point</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game Itâs the end of another quest with your ridiculous masters. Youâre enjoying a drink at the local tavern with your fellow squires, recounting the journey. What happened? What did you have to do to keep your masters alive? Tell your stories, maybe embellish them a little, and have a laugh at their expense. Squires is a meta-TTRPG where you recount your journey of being a squire for an inept adventurer. Open up an adventure from any other tabletop roleplaying game and use it for the structure of your story. The mechanics of the adventure donât matter, so pick any story you like. Use the mechanics in this pamphlet to see what your adventurer masters do (and how they inevitably fail), then use your skills to intervene and save their lives. Squires is available to download as a trifold pamphlet in A4 and US letter sizes. A separate page of player sheets is also available. This work is based on the Roll Up! TTRPG system by Ten Acre Games. Squires is copyright © Ten Acre Games and Hugh Lashbrooke . It is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 International licence.

<TITLE>Metanarrative</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Written for the Unearthed Expansions Jam , Metanarrative is not, primarily, an expansion for a game but an expansion for a book about games and the stories that we use games to tell. Metanarrative mechanizes Alexander Swordsâ Forest Paths Method while introducing to it a layer of randomness. As such, Metanarrative is a game about the making of game narratives (thus the name). Play is one-on-one, gm-less, and story-focused. It only requires a deck of cards (including jokers) to play. Metanarrative utilizes the basic structure of War , but with a new set of mechanics layered on top. This makes Metanarrative a ttrpg expansion for War as much as it is for the Forest Paths Method. This is very much a âversion zero.â Feedback welcome! Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Everytime I Think About Stopping I Go A Little Further And Find Something Beautiful</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Initially started as something completely different for the 7 DAY FPS JAM. I had to bail on the group I was with due to the madness of my existence. I came back to the unfinished heap of the game over holidays and decided to let it take itself where ever it wanted to go. The result is an odd story featuring my own narration about the struggles of collaboration, motivation, and finding meaning in the process of creating digital art. I will be the first to admit it heavily rips off The Beginner's Guide. Note: I'm pretty new to using Unreal5 so this is very poorly optimized and will require a decent GPU. I'm using a Radeon RX6800M for reference. Controls: WASD - Movement Space - Jump Mouse - Camera Left Click - Shoot Projectile Shout out to Reid Gillis for being a good sport and trying to get the initial jam to work.

<TITLE>Late Submission</TITLE>
<TEXT>Late Submission | A PCG Level Design Project | Chase down your alternate universe self in this metanarrative to get your 2D rogue-lite dungeon crawler assignment submitted before the deadline, in this 2D rogue-lite dungeon crawler assignment! 1. Generation can be inconsistent at times. If you encounter rooms with enemies before the main boss fight (3rd generation), you might have to restart, or use cheats to complete the level (List of cheats below) 2. There have been rare instances of the level completely failing to generate after 32 attempts. This is incredibly rare, and currently due to time constraints and an overall lack of understanding for what causes this error in the first place (due to the difficulty in debugging an error that happens every 10000 generations), it has not been fixed. If this happens, the entire generator will break, and you will need to restart the entire game. 3. To activate cheats, press the '/' key while in game (This is disabled in the starting scene). A small white box should appear on the bottom left, which is the "console". Typing will fill up the console, you can use Backspace to clear it. When you have typed a valid command, hit Enter to activate the command. Cheats: > "tp" : Teleports the player the the cursors position. (Use this in combination with the F2 key to teleport around the map) > "nohit" : Toggles godmode. Hitting F3 will also toggle godmode. > "mmm" : Gives the player 100 coins. This should be enough to buy out an entire shop. > "idkfa": Spawns all the weapon types around the player. They may be stacked on one another, you can just pick them up to shuffle them around. > "boom": Toggles infinite damage. This has been hardcoded to only bring the boss from one phase to another, so shooting the final boss will bring you to the phase 2 cutscene. > F1: Instantly regenerates the map, resetting all values. > F2: Hold to zoom out, RMB to look around. > F3: Toggles godmode.

Amazing game! I wonder how you did such a game in construct, especially the recursive bit. Well done! Cool game! An option to be able to restart without refreshing the browser would be nice. Press down a few times! Awesome work! :O Really fun and original, it's challenging and really tied up nicely, kudos for the rhythm-based behaviour of the game! Good job! Id make infinite levels and release this game for mobile and steam if I were you. Fantastic game Interesting little game. It can be kinda hard to tell at the start which block(s) you are controlling without jumping / moving, which may kill you. It also seems possible to get stuck in some levels without any option to restart, requiring refreshing the page. The levels are well designed though and can teach you the different mechanics / types of blocks in the game. Thanks! It was easy to know who you were controlling before downscaling the game, but time was very limited for me and could not polish it as much as I wanted. I want to fix a lot of things and add a difficulty curve based on sets of levels instead of just random! Thanks for the kind words!</TEXT>

The editor and its assistant Cuppit are all part of the game; anyone involved in game or level design should appreciate the humor. The editor is an exercise of twisted logic and lateral thinking. You have to see it to believe it; with its offbeat controls, inventory items that kill you, and intentional misspellings, it's the weirdest thing since sliced bread!

<TITLE>Meta Station</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game After powering up a mysterious game console, our hero, Joe, is trapped in a 2d game. its up to you to help him reach the exits and escape. ------------------------------------------- the idea is that each game cartridge gives your character different game abilities and inventory items that you can use to reach the key and door, but sadly due to time constraints the game is too broken to be played as intended and the tutorial is only half done. only the Kirby character can go through all levels (more due to bugs then actual intent) but in theory the other characters can also finish some of the levels, so if you're up for a challenge give it a try! :) btw, the intro is interactive, click the mouse to go through the sequence. controls - mouse. make sure you play in window mode otherwise the frame is cut off. ------------------------------------------- credits: game design and art - Galit "shoze" Weisberg programming - Ivan Latypov, Adam Villarreal sound - Daniel Yehezkeli fonts - telegrama, gamecuben ------------------------------------------- Project is open sourced and available at: https://github.com/metamorphling/Meta-Jam-Project Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Meta Controls plugin for RPG Maker MV</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool This is a RPG Maker MV plugin that lets you control switches and variables that last across a meta level on a game. A switch or variable designated to function as a meta switch or meta variable can persist across different save files. To assist in controlling meta properties of the game some more, the developer can assign common events to run at the start of a new game or when a game is loaded. Saving the game can also register map data to variables. Common Event on New Game: Run this common event when a new game is started. Leave as 0 to not use this function. Common Event on Load: Run this common event when a game is loaded. Leave as 0 to not use this function. Variables on Save: If any of these are set to variables, then those variables will acquire the Map ID, Map X position, or Map Y position whenever the player makes a save. Let's say you create three new games A, B, and C. If in playthrough A, you save in files 1 and 2, then <Local Meta> data will affect both files 1 and 2. They will not affect the saves from playthroughs B and C. To affect playthroughs B and C, it will have to be <Global Meta>. In playthrough B, you save in files 3, 4, 5. The saves made in playthroughs A and C will not be affected by the <Local Meta> data made during playthrough B and its saves. To affect them all, use <Global Meta>. For playthrough C, save files 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are used. All other playthroughs are completely unaffected by the <Local Meta> data used in playthrough C. To affect other playthroughs, <Global Meta> has to be used. But there is a warning: <Local Meta> will not affect related playthroughs for save files made before installing this plugin. This is due to the lack proper linking across those saves to be used for meta data. This plugin is made for RPG Maker MV versions 1.6.1 and below. If you update RPG Maker MV past that and this plugin breaks, I am NOT responsible for it. 1. These plugins may be used in free or commercial games. 2. 'Fallen Angel Olivia' must be given credit in your games. 3. You are allowed to edit the code. 4. Do NOT change the filename, parameters, and information of the plugin. 5.

<TITLE>Meta Form$5</TITLE>
<TEXT>Surrealist point-and-click adventure game with some word play, a whole lot of escapism, a dab of humor, and a dollop of existential dread. The idea for the story came from constantly dreaming about being stuck in small indoor spaces and looking for nature. Likely a reflection of living in quarantine. While not the first creation in The Abandoned universe, this is the first released creation. We currently have a Graphic Novel in the works as well as a larger game. Join us at https://aesth.games/ for updates on those endeavors. -------------------------- Update 2021-02-14: Added the OST for sale. Update 2021-02-01: Official release! Update 2020-12-01: Made several improvements to the text, as well as QoL changes and performance fixes. Added official music. -------------------------- Credits Art & Scene Concepts: c0hil https://www.instagram.com/c0hil/ Game Design, Programming, Writing, UI, Music: Casey "Boz" Weeks https://boz-float.itch.io/ -------------------------- Thank you to all musicians who allowed us to use their music in the previous versions of Meta Form: https://tensticks.bandcamp.com/ https://3six.net/ https://soundcloud.com/user-589036812-258992427/ A special thank you to everyone who helped test Meta Form - future players are carried upon your broken backs. aesthgame@gmail.com for inquiries.

Thank you so mush for the demo, a great source of inspiration, I really like the ambiance, the music and the poetry ! I loved it! Very interesting experience Fantastic! Thank you for letting me know :) Really enjoyed played! It definitely hit home a little bit. I'm glad you enjoyed it and also recorded a video of your play through! Thanks :) great game, really enjoyed it. the way it handles internal struggles is well done. thanks for putting it in the bundle. gameplay question, don't read if you haven't played: . . . i finished the game(loved entrophy's look and music). but i had one question, is it possible to change beliefs or sfeilb? i got the totems from them (total 10) but i was wondering if i was supposed to do something with the shrine to make the beliefs stop worshipping or if i was only supposed to get reflect for the mirror. thanks again! You know, you're actually not the first person to ask that. That's a layer deeper than I was thinking and now I want to make that mean more based on feedback, but you're correct - it's just to get the reflection. And thanks for playing! made me cry. It's an interesting game to say the least . . . i like it I want to say that makes me happy to hear, but that sounds wrong. I'll just leave it at I'm happy you liked it! Hello, I wanted to ask if you'd be willing to have one of your games be part of a Visual Novel co-op bundle? I'm planning to run the bundle from March 7th to 21st. Revenue would be split equally. And the bundle price would be set at $1 USD per game. Let me know if you have any questions. Howdy, I'm interested - send me details at aesthgame@gmail.com :) What an experience. Amazing concept. Great Wordplay. Quite the ending. Excellent game, short and compelling. The writing, visuals, and music are spot on, and the gameplay mechanic is clever and fun. Hey! Glad you enjoyed :) And thank you so much for the help along the way with the Dialogue System for Unity. --- Note to other game devs that may see this comment: If anyone else is wondering about the dialogue system in this game, this is the creator! Check it out, it helped this game move right along during the jam and the creator is super helpful and responsive: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672</TEXT>

<TITLE>Meta Checkpoint</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Meta Checkpoint is a game about trains racing across multiple levels to pass through the most amount of checkpoints. Sit down, either by yourself or with friends and family, to enjoy a calm, turn based competitive game! In this game your main adversary is yourself!! This is the first game that I have made on the itch.io page, and although it is far from the first game I've ever made, it is the first one I have completed. With all of life to bog down development, the project has taken a long time to make, especially since it has been done pretty much by a single person, me. Regardless, I am proud to present it to the public. A special thanks to all of the friends and family that have helped me and supported me on this project, from play-testing to coding guidance. And a special thanks to the Huegels for inspiring this video game adaptation of the family classic, Meta! I've learned a lot while making this game, and many things were my first attempt, things like music, publishing and sound design. It is far from perfect and could certainly be improved upon. Because this is just a hobby, I cannot promise that Meta will be updated and continually cared for, as I might just forget about its existence. I hope you enjoy and have fun!

<TITLE>META - tactical battle arena</TITLE>
<TEXT>Aimed at players that enjoy PvP tactics and strategy, but find MOBA and RTS games too twitchy or time consuming. Hi! My name is Petar IvanÄek and I would like to share a gamplay concept I've been working on. GAMEPLAY: CHALLENGE: Try to defeat the AI in less than 5 minutes. BUGS & TIPS: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Seems like a great base to expand on, it's already very fun as is. A way to see what each units stats and abilities are before you pick them and without having to worry about time would be great, so you don't have to play a run with each unit to really know how they work. An active pause could be interesting too, to let you plan out combos or time abilities more easily. Great prototype overall I would LOVE to hear your comments, they are the sole reason for release. With your feedback this concept can be expanded into something more elaborate. Thanks!</TEXT>

These are excellent and thank you so much for sharing them for free. So having listened to all three variations, and except for some but not all of the sounds in Variation 3, none of these sound much like American English. which means these three variations don't have the kind of variety I was hoping for. All of them sound accented, to my ear, vaguely Eastern European, or in some cases, perhaps Middle Eastern. Any plans on releasing these broadly useful "barks" with any different accents like say American English or British English, or is that something you can't do on your own? (I could help with American English barks. I've been messing around with recording various things in audacity lately. My British accent is probably fairly unconvincing, though.) Also, I notice that the actual text of the barks seems identical to those you released in Voice Pack 1. Is one of the three audio variations here also identical to that pack? Hey Legion, Glad you loved the asset. You are right on the accent part; it's middle-east! To be honest, at this point we don't have any particular plans on making an extension of these packs. However, if we get a good demand for the same, then we may plan it someday.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Military Hangout: Part Two</TITLE>
<TEXT>really hard to beat (and really buggy just a warning) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Positive things: Jumping and moving feels smooth. The level setup is ok'ish. I would definitely improve the balance though, the turrets make it unreasonably hard to maneuver. Make them fire less often, slower or make them destroyable. Oh and there's a bug, if you move your mouse cursor too far away from the player, it stops aiming. it was an old project from like 2 years ago but I found it and decided to post it. Once I am done the project I am currently working on I will remake the game (because the code and stuff for this game is all messed up). Yes I am aware of these bugs, and the turrets are destroyable its just that they have 20 health and the bullets only do 1 damage. But as I said I am currently remaking these games and I will make sure to take this into consideration. Thank you! click 2 shoot and AD to move, and Spacebar to jump, Shift to crouch and S to run</TEXT>

Every streamer hopes to successfully match the interests of their target audience with enticing stream alert sounds, but few do. With our distinctive fusion of suspense-filled cinematic orchestral, choral, and military-influenced alert sounds, we at ESM have successfully caught the essence of this, creating a totally unique experience for you and all of your viewers. You now have access to sounds for the New Cheer, New Donation, New Follower, New Host, New Raid, and New Subscriber alerts. You may receive alert noises with Military Epic Orchestral that are layered with dramatic, daring cinematic soundscapes for some breath-taking sounds that will astound your audience. Get ready for a memorable Twitch Streaming experience with Military Epic Orchestral Alert Streaming Sounds by packing your baggage and inviting your viewers along! What is the significance of alert sounds? Sound alerts, when used correctly, can significantly improve the quality of your stream. Sounds, when used correctly, can surprise or delight your viewers, increasing their likelihood to engage and chat. During a heated livestream, one or two events may be lost in the heat of the moment. If the creator is about to face a difficult boss or is the last survivor of a match, the stream takes a back seat for a while. There are alert sounds or stream alerts to ensure that donations, new subscribers, followers, raids, and other events receive the attention they deserve. The alert sounds are fantastic for live streams and increasing engagement, but they also work exceptionally well as video game notifications, game wins, victory cues, and positive reinforcement.

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows @kittycalis | @jwaaaap Players often have expectations when it comes to videogames, and can have completely different interpretations you probably haven't considered. What happens when an ordinary exploration game is used as an expressive extension of these expectations? Interactions in a virtual space are shaped not only by what is presented, but also by all spaces previously visited. This is one such space and you're right at the door...

<TITLE>Jan Ken Fight!</TITLE>
<TEXT>Jan Ken Fight is an adaptation of the famous game: rock-paper-scissors. Created for the GBJAM7, it takes on the appearance of a Gameboy versus-fighting game, but with a pinch of similarity with an old Final Fantasy. I hope the mix will be to your taste ;-) The controls of the games are : 1/ Rock-paper-scissors sequence : - up arrow = paper - right arrow = scissors - down arrow = rock 2/ Before enemy attacks : - left arrow = counter n.b. : you need counter(s) in stock to perform one! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Cool Idea. Love the graphics and subtle BG music. Game could be a bit faster, seems like too much time waiting. The initial instructions screen were a bit fast. But nice concept Thanks for playing my game and providing good pieces of feedback ;-)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Jan Ken Crush</TITLE>
<TEXT>The evil CEO of the Forpes Group, the multi-planetary corporation, known as Conkis has forced its employees (every galactic citizen) to compete in an infernal Rock Paper Scissors (Jan Ken Pon in Japan (thus the title)) tournament. The winner will earn the right to claim the title of Grand Champion and earn a shot to battle Conkis itself. Upon the declaration creating this perverse tournament, Conkis also said it would vaporize the entire galaxy for sport and amusement if the Grand Champion cannot defeat it. This is not about bragging rights, this is not about sport, this is not even about your life, but the life of everything in the galaxy. Can you gather the four cups of the Forpes Group, the Dorbal Cup, the Pitchkal Cup, the Nasal Cup, and the coveted Forpes Cup itself to earn the title of Grand Champion and save the galaxy? "Jan Ken Crush" is envisioned as a combination of retro character-driven fighting games (making the characters in this game doubly ridiculous though) and classic JRPG's with a JRPG style battle system refracted through the classic hand game Rock Paper Scissors/Jan Ken Pon. In addition to the hand game's original mechanics, a "Non" option can be combined with any of the original hand signals to block "attacks" and earn power stars that can increase attack power and unlock the "Heal" option that can be combined with a hand signal to substitute opponent damage with HP recovery. The game features a minimalist pixel-art graphic aesthetic with an exciting and nuanced retro synth soundtrack spiritually influenced by Nobuo Uemastu, Yasunori Mitsuda, John Carpenter, and classic Bollywood music.

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Content Warning - This Game Contains This game was made with teens and young adults as a target audience. If any of the above content warnings are anything you are NOT comfortable with, do not feel pressured to play. The consideration to check out my project was more than enough :) The Game!! Don't you hate it when you're friends are wrong? Do you wish your arguments could be settled by turn based debates? Are you always right? If you answered yes to any of these questions, not only are you eligible for emotional compensation (not literally please I am in college and the paychecks are not pay checking) but this game was also made for you! Enjoy crushing your (my) friends in a rock paper scissors style turn based game, where you argue till you drop! Meet the characters!!! Steve!! Your best friend, and an ultimate instigator. Hates arguing but still will do it! Steve is probably the smartest person you know, so he's bound to tackle your arguments with Logic. Nathan!! Steve's younger cousin, who is also one of your best friends. A fellow victim of Steve's undeniable instigation talent, and man can he yell. The intellect runs in the family, so make sure you keep on your toes when arguing with him. REMEMBER , don't get too in your head. Debating might be fun, but these are your friends. It's okay to disagree. CREDITS!! Director!! W. Buckle Lead Programmer!! W. Buckle Programming Help!! Richard Wetzel Nicole O. Buckle Voice Acting!! Buckle - W. Buckle Steve - Steve Bella Nathan - Nathan Mendrano Music!! YogCrashN'Smash Yog's BlueSky! Check out Yog's stuff! Very talented creator and a good friend of mine! Sprite Art!! W. Buckle Writing!! W. Buckle Special Thanks!! If you are reading this far, you are either my professor, someone in my family, or one of my many friends, or maybe a stranger checking out a new game. Whoever you are, thank you for supporting me in my goal of becoming a game designer. This is the first project of many, so look forward to my next game!! The next one will be much more polished on release, that I can promise. Potential Updates and Director Notes!! Hi! I have come to hold this game very dear to my heart, so even though it started as a project for a class, I might come back to this game and update it! Here are some thing's you might be able to expect in a future update! If there is an X by a game, that means it is currently being worked on! If it is crossed out, that means it is implemented in the current released build of the game! Game built for WINDOWS ONLY, potential updates might add compatibility for Mac, but not confirmed.

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and Linux toki! mi musi li tan e musi pali pi toki pona. mi sin e toki pona. mi sin e musi pali. mi sin e ale. musi li pona ala pona? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As I tried to say, I'm new to toki pona, so I'm gonna have to leave a large part of this in English (for now?) I'm new to basically everything involved here. This is the first game I've uploaded to itch, it's the first time I did any 3d animation, it's not quit e the first time I worked with godot, but it's the first game that got anywhere near playable with it. Anyway, controls are space or enter to accept the initial dialog, then WASD for moving and mouse for camera. ESC will quit. If you're on controller, it should be A to accept, and left joystick for moving, and right for camera, but I didn't test with a controller. B should quit. (If it doesn't, keyboard controls still work, so ESC will close) I also only tested the exe for windows, but I uploaded the linux one too. I couldn't get the mac one to build, something about a compression scheme, which seemed like it might change enough to break things, especially when I'd have no way to test it worked. (I don't own a mac) Also there's a small rendering problem with the shadows. I think it's a genuine problem with Godot's rendering, and I'm gonna write a bug report about it, but I have no way to fix it right now. Anyway, hope you enjoy!

<TEXT>A downloadable mod OK GUYS MY FIRST TRAIT! can you believe it! Alright let's cut to the chase. How is it that our toddlers can get the independent trait and not have it when aging up? well this trait is that but a lil more ......mature for a better term of words only because of what the buffs may say.. Who can use this trait? Teens Young Adults Adults Elders This mod comes with several replacement buffs, a few custom buffs and Interactions The mood the sim with this trait is typically in will be focused and inspired. They feel other emotions too don't worry, these two are just more prevalent This sim will always have something toward building a business on their own. I have no clue where the pics i uploaded are but those are just some of the buffs that is in store for you guys! * get to know more on a personal level does NOT initiate woohoo, though I would like it too I have no idea how at the moment, but it DOES give you an answer via buffs! * asking if they are depending on someone does NOT initiate the ask if single notification, but it DOES gives you an answer via buffs! But be careful, because they may be lying. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If i think of anything else to add to this trait i will update this post with a new download! Please let me know how it works for you! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Madeline</TITLE>
<TEXT>Madeline is a prodigy child. Since she is very good in the arts of fighting, she's admitted to the training school of the Purple Legion at a very young age. The Legion is made up of expert warriors and wizards who aim to protect the world from evil forces, and for that purpose they learned and teached the ancient art of manipulating Crystals to become stronger. After a few years of training, Madeline's agile movements and precise skills made her the most suitable person for an important mission. Her master, Ettore , informs that all along he had been preparing her to defend the world from a mystical invasion foreseen by some old prophecy. That's when he sends her to the Ancient Forest in order to investigate what is causing this imbalance and close the magical rifts that are open. FOR BETTER EXPERIENCE PLAY AS FULL SCREEN THIS GAME'S STILL A DEMO CONTROLS A - LEFT D - RIGHT E - ACTION X - SKIP DIALOGUE Q - SKILL SHIFT/SPACE - JUMP (HOLD TO JUMP HIGHER) LEFT MOUSE - ATTACK AND MOVE BLOCKS RIGHT MOUSE - SWAP PLATFORMS (OPACITY) âMadelineâ is our first game (still a demo ), which started out as a simple project among friends, but as it came to life it became something bigger and that we are very excited to continue. For the time being we offer the first stage of the game, located in the Ancient Forest, and we intend to develop two other levels. The intent of our game is to give you the experience of a sidescroller platformer with an interesting level of difficulty. One that you can combine moments of combat and exploration in balance with puzzles that require precision. All this wrapped up with some intriguing story. So, now we ask for your support. If you liked the game (or even if not) we want to know your opinion! Leave a comment about the fluidity of the game, especially in relation to movement, combat, level of difficulty, and also about the visuals and narrative aspects if you can. Or just answer our form, we promise it only takes 2 minutes. We really want to hear you out. And thank you for the gameplay!

Eu amei, e considero que as crÃ­ticas do pessoal que tÃ¡ criticando nos comentÃ¡rios sÃ£o super vÃ¡lidas concordo com tudo que li. TÃ¡ muito legal o jogo de vocÃªs. Obrigada por testar o jogo! Estamos pegando todas as criticas e ja tendo uma ideia para melhorarmos o jogo. Muito obg e ficamos muito felizes que tenha gostado e se divertido <3 The game has very nice graphics, and good sound. I like the idea of the portal, it is interesting. But here are some constructive criticisms: -Already in the first portal it becomes very difficult to pass the game. It cost me 100 lives to go to the next level and, on top of that, losing generates more anxiety to pass it, which makes you make more mistakes. Perhaps to lower the difficulty a little, I would put checkpoints within the level because I happened to die several times near the end and it made me angry to have to start from scratch from that level. I make this opinion on the basis that today's society wants everything now. Few people stop to keep trying to win it, many get tired and take it out. -There is something in the jump that does not convince me at all. I would try to play a little with the gravity or the mass of the player to see if that way it improves. -If you have in mind to sell it in the future, I would add the option to mute the music, because although the music is very good and I mean it, after a while of losing several times the music begins to sound irritating. -A pause menu would also be good, it is not totally necessary but it always adds up. Out of all the criticism that I comment, I see a game with potential for them to continue developing and improving. By the way I liked the AI of the enemies. I am also currently developing my first platform video game and the part of developing the AI of the enemies seems the most complicated to me, they did an excellent job with that. I hope the reviews help you to improve it. And to move on, developing video games is awesome. Sorry for the length of the message. Hey Javier, we want to thank you for the comment and tips about the game. We are glad that we could cause good impression about it. We made the game thinking about in a hard dificulty , but is still a demo, and maybe we can change this to be a little bit easier. We are still thinking in few mechanics to put in the game, a pause menu and mute are one of them! We hope you had fun playing, and thank you one more time! <3 Achei a sinopse muito interessante e a gameplay bastante fluida e divertida bom game :) Que bom que gostou John, agradecemos pelo feedback <3 Agumas coisas podem ser melhoradas "sugestÃµes" em questÃ£o de jogabilidade 1- Os dialogos podem conter algo que acelere eles, pois muitas vezes apos vc ter visto uma vez e apertar sem querer vai ter que esperar todo aquele tempo novamente. 2- O Jogo fica fazendo som de atacar direto e a musica esta muito curta. 3- Seria muto mais dinamico e interessante se as plataformas movessem sozinhas e sÃ³ parasse no lugar quando vc desativa-la, ir com omouse para fazer essa aÃ§Ã£o deixa o jogo muito lento, poderia usar o teclado de maneira a deixar mais confortavel, tem um monte de teclas para usar nÃ£o ha necessidade de colocar tudo junto. 4- Pulos muitas vezes pixel perfect, o que para um iniciante acaba desistimuando, pois ele vai errar demais e sÃ£o poucos os jogadores que sÃ£o hardcore e vÃ£o continuar. 5- Acredito que nÃ£o hÃ¡ necessidade de usar mouse e teclado sendo que ele nÃ£o usa constantemente os 2, se fosse um jogo de tiro constante guiado a mira pelo mouse ok, mas para ativar algumas vezes algumas plataformas, sendo que as mesmas poderiam mover sozinhas, acho que acaba Ã© atrapalhando a jogabilidade. 5- Colocar uma outline ex"branca" no seu jogador e tudo que for ativo, para eles destacarem do cenario. 6- A mecanica das plataformas me lembrou muito a do jogo do MarcosgameDev, chamado "Polarized Giants", talvez possa te dar algumas referencias de mecanicas. Espero ter ajudado, boa sorte na evoluÃ§Ã£o de seu projeto, um grande abraÃ§o! Laerte, primeiramente gostariamos de agradecer muito pelo seu feedback e pelas sugestÃµes, com certeza nos ajudarÃ¡ bastante no futuro! Vamos la. 1- Realmente esquecemos de colocar nos controles, mas esse botÃ£o existe sim, seria a tecla 'x'. Adicionei na descriÃ§Ã£o do jogo! 2- NÃ£o conseguimos entender 'som de atacar direto', seria algum efeito sonoro que vocÃª acha que esta atrapalhando a jogabilidade? A mÃºsica tem mais de um minuto e meio, e como Ã© um jogo com muitas mortes, achamos que Ã© bastante improvÃ¡vel a mÃºsica chegar no final. 3- A mecÃ¢nica da plataforma foi pensada como um puzzle, onde vocÃª teria que pensar pra onde puxaria, e atÃ© onde puxaria. Se colocassemos uma plataforma que se mexesse sozinha, esse puzzle que estÃ¡vamos planejando nÃ£o funcionaria mais. Usamos o mouse para a mecÃ¢nica por que realmente nao saberiamos outro modo de arrastar os blocos alÃ©m desse. 4- Pensamos em fazer o jogo com uma dificuldade avanÃ§ada, com intuito de manter o jogador envolvido no puzzle atÃ© conseguir. Com ctz nÃ£o serÃ£o todos que vÃ£o ter muita paciencia, mas decidimos correr o risco! 5- Acho que falei algo parecido sobre isso na resposta 3. Referente ao mouse, como usamos ele para mover os blocos, decidimos colocar o ataque no mouse tambÃ©m, para ser usado nas duas partes da fase e nÃ£o apenas dentro da fenda, o que seria menos dinÃ¢mico, fazendo o jogador tirar e colocar a mÃ£o do mouse. 6- Colocar uma outline na arte nÃ£o seria uma opÃ§Ã£o para nosso jogo, ficaria muito diferente de tudo. Mas vamos pensar em uma outra mecÃ¢nica para poder destacar mais os objetos interativos. 7- Obrigada pela referÃªncia! Demos uma olhada, e nesse jogo as plataformas mudam sozinhas pelo que pude ver, elas teem um tempo para trocar, pelo que entendi. Acho que essa mecÃ¢nica nÃ£o seria a ideal para nosso jogo. Mas quem sabe mais pro futuro podemos pensar em algo para usar! Mais uma vez agradecemos pelo feedbaack! Espero que tenha se divertido com o jogo <3 O jogo tem o melhor da ambientaÃ§Ã£o dos clÃ¡ssicos 2D, com a trilha sonora muuuito boa, a arte incrÃ­vel e com uma narrativa que dÃ¡ vontade de ir atÃ© o final. Amei muito!! ParabÃ©ns para todo mundo envolvido (: Muito obrigada Matheus. Agradecemos o feedback e ficamos felizes que a jogabilidade e a narrativa te prenderam a ponto de querer finalizar o jogo! Muito bom, mecÃ¢nicas de jogo inovadoras , temÃ¡tica e desenho do jogo incrÃ­veis, o trilha sonora muito boa. Espero que tenham calma, carinho, e muita paciÃªncia com a luta que vem pela frente. Boa sorte para a equipe de desenvolvimento. Obrigada pelo feedback Rodrigo. Ainda tem muito trabalho a fazer, mas ficamos felizes que gostou. Uau !! Ficou massa parabÃ©ns para toda a equipe . Muito obrigado Celenny, ficamos felizes! I loved <3 !! thank you <3 It's is good and amazing :) ihulll We are happy that you liked, thanks for the comment! <3</TEXT>

<TITLE>Madeline the Matchmaking Kitchen Witch</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game -Unfortunately I can't get the html version to work so it's downloadable for now. I'll try and get that fixed pronto. Also something is wrong with the trait reveal screen so it's showing some wrong numbers.- A buggy and unfinished version of my Ludum Dare entry! The theme was "one room" so I made mine with the starting idea of a kitchen. It's aggressively cutesy, so prepare yourself, if you don't think too hard about it being basically frankenstein's escort service. The main aim is to learn the effects of every spice. Ideally the mechanic for that should be more complex, and there should be more requests for you to work it out in time. I of course instead of fixing the bugs made the cauldron smoke change colour according to the selected spices and added sprites for the creations that have hair, eye and skin colour that depends on their "ingredients". The game was entirely made by me including all the assets, although I wish some of them weren't! I'll write a better, less self deprecating description and maybe do some bug fixes tomorrow. For now, enjoy the bugginess!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game Madeline Quest 3 is the third in the Madeline Quest series where you venture into Madeline dreams, haunted by versions of her sister, her father and herself. Unlike SNABR this is less of a remaster and more of just and update to the newest version of FNAF Maker and the removal of the mask mechanic as it was pointless in retrospect.

<TITLE>Madeline's Return - A Celeste Classic 2 Mod</TITLE>
<TEXT>For my first PICO-8 Project, I decided to mod Madeline from Celeste Classic into Celeste Classic 2 . Its strongly recommended you play the originals first. Controls: Z, X, Arrow keys, and Return to Pause I learned a lot making this mod. Please leave Feedback and screenshots of your final times below! The game can also be found here: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=129671#p Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Super fun!!! All 16 Strawberries. 12 Deaths. Time 4 Mins Fun Pretty fun! Way easier than the original Lani's Trek, haha. Though I was always a bigger fan of dashing than Lani's grapple thing. think I did alright I'm pretty sure I've soft locked myself. I'm in the sky playforms section with the spike posts. I managed to collect the strawberry by backtracking to the springpad, but I think I needed it to go forward. Yup, went back. I think it's the very last strawberry that you can get stuck on if you collect it in the wrong way. I FOUND A WAY TO BEAT THIS ROOM WITHOUT THE BERRY! if you dash into the bottom right corner of a spiked block from the underneath, and spam jump, it gives you the wall jump off of the spike, and if you conserve one dash, you can barely make it to the balloon. WE BALL!!!!!! I speedran this and ended with a 2:28 after a lot of tries. edit: I GOT 2:26 AND IT WAS UNOPTIMISED later that same day: I GOT 2:21 SOMEHOW pretty hard on the last section but 06:31 28 deaths 9 minutes 6 seconds, all berries, 66 deaths Nice! Hope you had fun! nice job. it's definitely easier with double jump Thanks! I kinda want to put Lani in Celeste Classic to see what thats like...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Celestn't is a physics based platformer that is a parody of Celeste that asks the question every Celeste player is totally wondering: ' What if Madeline never showed up to save Theo from the mirror temple?' . Reading controls is highly recommended! The original version was made in 3 hours as part of a game jam ! However, due to a random burst in speedruns of the game , I felt like it would be a good idea to add a few QOL and bug fixes features listed below to make it easier and more consistent to speedrun!

I'm still Wondering why the nun wants me Do you plan on making a 2nd game to explain the mystery behind Mother Madeline and what just happened to her victims? I also encountered a very minor thing- at the long hallway, there are invincible barrier/ item that blocks my path but moving either left or right let's me pass through You did 2 out of 3 endings :D Yes I can make a 2nd game, feedback is being really great! Thanks for your feedback about the barriers, It may be a collision issue, I'll check it out :) there's 3 endings?! I have to find that 3rd one, I'll be re uploading the video once I find it (I love completing endings and I think I know how to get it). looking forward for the 2nd game! I TRIED! I could not do it. You did great! Thanks for playing :) Thank you! < 3 I gave the game a shot and it is fairly fun. Having the timer visible on the screen helps with tension and while the puzzles were easy enough to figure out, I wish there was some harder ones. Overall, a nice escape room horror game.

<TITLE>2023 Summer Camp Game: Origin Legends by Team Imposter Girls (Ellie P., Elora C., Stuti P., Madeline D.)</TITLE>
<TEXT> Team Imposter Girls (Ellie P., Elora C., Stuti P., Madeline D.) designed and developed this game at the Girls Make Games 3-week summer camp. To learn more, visit www.girlsmakegames.com Game Summary: Our game is about a character named Azule, who was abandoned by her parents. When her parents send her a message via their giant technological horse, she learns that she is the only hybrid between humans and azaleans (an alien species) and she must choose which of her parents to live with: her azalean father or human mother. Along the way, she will learn about the history of the humans and azaleans by reading the ancient scrolls throughout the dark forest and space. Eventually, she will be forced to choose a side, and it may have greater implications than she can imagine. Game Controls: Arrow keys to move E to interact Space to attack Game Story: The protagonist is a hybrid character between azaleans and humans. She must choose a side to support to end the war between azaleans and humans. The protagonistâs mother and father abandoned their child because of the war, and now they live in separate shelters, one for the humans and one for the azaleans. Inspiration: Madeline had been planning a game about aliens for a long time, and she was excited to get a professional artist to help bring her aliens to life. Thatâs part of why she suggested the game focus on aliens. We also wanted to make a game that didnât make one side, aliens OR humans, the definitive bad guys. About the Creators: We like bread, demons, and bread demons (and other inside jokes). Elora is the kool kid, Ellie is the chaos Azalean, Madeline is the silent anime enthusiast, and Stuti is the surgical bookworm (Dr. D Capitate).</TEXT>

<TITLE>Celestn't (Jam Version)</TITLE>
<TEXT>Controls and notes (Recommended to read if stuck) Why does this game exist? This game was made for the 235th Trijam , a game jam in which you only get 3 hours of programming time to make a game! The theme was 'a parody of a popular game or movie'. This game is a parody of Celeste , an incredible 2D platformer, or at least the level in which you carry your friend Theo in a crystal prison. Now imagine that Madeline wasn't there to carry Theo and BOOM this game is exactly that. Clip of the original (Spoilers OFC!!): Credits: Music is "Cruising for Goblins" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (Yes, it is the exact same as my last game jam games music and yes I did run out of time lmao) MarvinPl for speedrunning this game so many times Rose/rzaew for fixing controls table on this page Cool development bits: Final thoughts: I'm very happy with the gameplay! I managed to cut corners in a way that didn't sabotage the gameplay, however the graphics are very uninteresting (apart from Theo himself) and the music is just open source. There is a wind sound and you might hear it once but unfortunately it breaks after the first time it plays.. But overall, I'm happy! :) Thanks for reading and/or playing! My PB: 45.7756740000006 Soph :) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I got I better time than all you, I did this buy getting to the end and then starting the timer Good idea and, when it's at it's best, super fun. It definitely could do with polishing and general making the game feel better but it's super impressive that this was done in 3 hours! Well done! Hello again PLAY-MEK!! And yeah definitely, it could use better level design and maybe the low friction was a bit extreme. I doubt I will come back to this one but I am proud I managed to complete a game in 3 hours, thank you! :L I am. bad at platforming.fun though dw the game itself is pretty difficult since its so reliant on momentum, and thank you!</TEXT>

It also comes with a neat (in my opinion!) turn tracker. You can print out and tape together pages 3&4 to make a table stand so everyone can easily see the action options, if that's the kind of thing you enjoy. Actions don't have rules associated- you can insert the action descriptions from your system. Cover art is from here ( https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8678/landscape-with-trees-pond-and-sheep ).

<TITLE>The Mad Hack</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game This is a game I made to play with my friends. It combines some of my favorite things about B/X, SEACAT, and 5e. Getting started with character creation is simple, but the characters are highly customizable and fairly good at surviving damage. My favorite thing about this game is the base + topper class combinations. There are 50+ different classes possible when you combine the base and topper classes and it's fun to experiment with different options. You could be a Barbarian Magic-User, Greenwitch Dwarf, or Psychic Rogue. Every topper class has a unique set of spells, too! This game comes with a baked-in setting with details about the 5 peoples of the canyon and the elves and dwarves who live above. It's meant to be a game of exploration - you are the first people in generations to find the magical world outside the canyon and explore it. There are also details about the Goddesses and a new, unaligned, alignment. I've play tested this fairly extensively and a lot of the modifications come from things my players asked for. Thank you to all my players who've given feedback! Art is from the amazing Evlyn Moreau's Patreon. There are likely still a lot of things that need to be tweaked, added, or removed; but at some point you need to shove your darlings out of the nest. Let me know if you read it, play it, enjoy it.

<TITLE>Cooking in Quarantine Game</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Blog by Olivia Moriarty, Madeline Fisher, Zach Gordon Olivia Moriarty: Art Style I spent some time searching for free asset packs on the Unity Asset Store. I wanted to have a large, sleek kitchen. I finally found a great modern kitchen asset pack that I could use to replace the white-box. See image below. For food, I searched for a pack that had a large variety of ingredients and final "meals." I found a great free asset pack on the Unity Asset Store that fit our look and feel. See image below. Zach Gordon: Level Design The first thing I did was white-box the level that conformed to all the things we needed. It was the first draft and would be changed before the project came to a close, but it did the job for a glimpse of what we wanted our game to be. Here are some screenshots of the white-box, taken from opposite corners for maximum visibility: Olivia Moriarty: Here are some pictures of the final stylized product! I had to scale the white-box down based on limitations from the free asset packs, but overall I was able to import everything fine and put together a large kitchen with multiple food items lying around for you to make your next meal! I also edited the buttons and replaced the text to make a sleek look and kept the red and black theme overall. (Edit: We've since added 2 more recipe buttons! See video attached for full gameplay) Gameplay / Scripting: Madeline Fisher The basic functionality of the game was used with a first person character controller from unity's standard asset pack. The player moves with the arrow keys and can look around and pick up items with the mouse. to pick up an item the player just has to click on it. The inventory system took a lot of separate components to work properly. I was not expecting an inventory to have so many parts but in the end it looks simple and is easy for the player to follow. As the user collects items the text on that item icon will increase in number so the player knows how many of each item they have. we wanted to add some randomness to the game so the buttons that create the recipe do not tell the user what exactly they are supposed to make. We wanted to have the player have the element of surprise in having to guess how many items they needed to create the recipe. Once the player has enough items for a recipe they are told what they have made by a text that appears and the icon of what they made appears in the right side of the screen. The goal for the player is to find all the items to create all the recipes. Coding - Located under Cooking in github link on main page Audio: Zach Gordon The last thing to be done was the audio scripting, once all the interactions had been coded into the game. We had to ditch GitHub due to some last minute issues, but we got things under control with some use of Google Drive. I got my work done just about on time, and I think the audio turned out mostly well-balanced. The biggest challenge of this part was working collaboratively without a proper version control service, of course, but I'm proud of how the sound turned out.

<TITLE>Hidden Oddities: A Witch's Primer$20</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable Digital Book Witches have been in the world as long as magic flowed from the source, the magic they wield is old, ritualistic, and powerful. They donât have to rely on gods, pacts, or untold years of study as their power comes from the gnosis of otherworldly beings who sought companionship and union with the witch. Those who bond with these beings start down the long path of becoming a witch. Not all survive this path, the established magical orders of the world see witches as a threat to their dominion. With their Sacred Secrets, each witch has access to powerful knowledge that only they can use and is hidden to all others. Because of this, far too many witches have been hunted down, persecuted, and interrogated. Most, have only survived by hiding or pretending to be druids, warlocks, or wizards but with the turning of the age, a record number of new witches are coming into their power and refuse to be hunted in the dark. What is this Book A Witchâs Primer contains new game material and worldbuilding content for 5e. In this fully searchable and bookmarked book, youâll find the brand new Witch class with 14 archetypes, 5 archetypes for the standard classes, 3 new backgrounds, feats, equipment, 102 new spells, and advice on how to place witches into your world. This supplement is designed to work inside the system and to expand the options for Game Masters and players. Before using anything from this book Players should ask their GMs about using any material. GMs can also use the new material from this book for designing nonplayer characters. Use what you want but most importantly, enjoy! How to use this Book The main goal of this book is to help you make and customize your new witch, personalizing them, and expanding playable options for characters of any class. The information in this book is meant to help guide both players and GMs. All the material in this book is completely new and even if a GM does not want to allow a player to be a witch, all of the material works equally for expanding options for NPCs. Also included are hand-drawn character sheets that are compatible with standard 5e play and with an additional sheet for the witch class. These come in both standard and form-fillable versions.

The character falls off the platform seen in the screenshot. He jumps off the platform that falls, lands on that one next to the fire, but goes down... hi! Thanks for playing. the platform needs to go down so you can turn and jump next to the fire. But Iâll check that out. hi! Yes I checked and itâs not a bug, like I said before, when you step in the second air platform you have to wait to go down to turn and jump. Because the third one is not at the same height. Oh... the perspective made me think all three platforms were in-line at the same levels, okey, thank you. :) Thank you ! ð¤ð¥ð¤</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows A boy wakes up in his attic with no idea how he got there, or how he will get out. This game was created for the past Asylum Jam in 2015. I didn't have time to finish it, and it's been sitting in my projects folder for a while until I decided to get back to it. As such, it's very short and minimalistic, but I hope you can enjoy the game anyway. To play, you have to download the HIDDEN file, uncompress it on any location in your computer, and double-click the GAME icon. If you run into any "missing files" error, you will have to download the RTP (Run TIme Package) for rpgmaker linked. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Pretty fun! Hi. My name is Mel. I was wondering if you could give me permission to translate your game into Spanish . If you do not mind, of course We are actually Spanish ourselves, but of course it would be great if you translated Hidden! :D Okay! :D Mola! Tengo que subir una actualizacion con un par de bug fixes, nada que afecte al texto (y veo una falta en las screencaps) EstÃ¡ bien! :D Ever thought of an MV port? It's not something that crossed our minds to be honest. Though hearing someone ask about it now makes us wonder... what is your opinion? Why did you think of it? :) I wouldn't mind helping out with it. I have MV and software to scale up the graphics to MV standards. ahHH i just finished playing it, it was a fun little game I liked the puzzles a lot ;v; I love the character busts too! Thank you so much! We are very happy you enjoyed the game. We are currently working on finishing another adventure game (Spirited Waters) with the same gameplay, hope you can play it and enjoy it as well. :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Hidden stories</TITLE>
<TEXT>Hidden stories is a short game about exploration and curiosity, memories and music. The player creates the mood and narration by the way he will have to move and discover the different elements dotted in the environment. Gameplay: - Keyboard arrows moves the character. - hold down Down key to expand its perception of history. This key consumes energy that can be regenerated by picking up crystals. There is no end game, the player can browse the story as long as he wants and leave the game when he no longer finds interest. Play it full screen. note: designed during the Construct French Game Jam 4 Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Le sound-design est vraiment cool ! =D De mÃªme, j'aime bien l'effet de transparence du personnage. C'est simple, mais Ã§a rend super bien, et crÃ©e une exploration et narration carrÃ©ment intÃ©ressante. Un vraiment chouette, jeu ! =) Je suis trÃ©s heureux que ce que j'ai voulu faire passer ai pu vous toucher, d'une maniÃ¨re ou d'une autre. Je ne voulais pas faire de concession sur cette rÃ©alisation car je voulais expÃ©rimenter. Mon but est que le joueur se sente un peu perdu et intriguÃ©. Dans une certaine mesure, il crÃ©er lui mÃªme son expÃ©rience ( musicale et narrative) avec les Ã©lÃ©ments prÃ©sents. l'absence de chemin ouvre toutes les voies, mÃªme si l'on peut aussi se perdre ( tiens je suis poÃ¨te ce soir ^^). Par contre je suis justement conscient d'avoir perdus beaucoup de testeurs Ã qui le jeu n'as pas parlÃ© du tout,^^ Wouaw ! La musique , le design .. c'est trÃ©s psychedelique . On est tout de suite transportÃ© comme dans un espece de reve/souvenir . Bravo a toi Ce jeu est une vÃ©ritable expÃ©riences, dommage que l'histoire soit courte je veux la suite !</TEXT>

This small game is for those who likes the hidden object genre that offers a relaxing activity with a really useful feature: helping you to study Spanish. The dedicated music of the game was made by AndrÃ¡s IllÃ©s who is a multi-instrumental musician and composer. *The MAC and OSX version aren't tested!

<TITLE>Hidden Dose</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS From MadLab we present a project that joins the world of video games and the well-known activities of EscapeRoom, creating a game that brings together both experiences taking advantage of their virtues. Hidden Dose is a videojugabilistic experience that simulates an EscapeRoom where we are put in the skin of the concierge of a biochemical laboratory in which, because of an accident, a virus has been released and has been quarantined. We (the player) are inside and have been infected, so we have a limited time to find out what is happening to us and how we can heal ourselves. Mechanically we are faced with a game of mystery and puzzles in first person in which our greatest antagonist is the stage. We must solve the different enigmas that we are encountering, know our surroundings and the incident to be able to escape. In addition, this is a non-linear experience in which mysteries can be solved in different order and it is not necessary to get all the clues and information to be able to complete it successfully. Each player faces the experience differently. Language: Spanish. Visit our web page: http://madlab.webcindario.com/ Download the file, Extract all in the same folder. Execute. Enjoy!

OH GOD NOW ITS RED what the fuck was 4 minutes ago me thinking what was I thinking when i made this game. ððð I don't know but have a good day/night help i cant stop suffocating and i have no idea on how to leave and ho to next level how did you get that far? ð at this I abandoned this game cause I made unrealistically hard at this point. I suggest just going everywhere to see a spot. Maybe I might update this but for now this is it. i sat still tbh to get to red for me suffocating was first might be different on other devices i sat still tbh to get to red for me suffocating was first might be different on other devices IT DOUBLED?! How many fears are there? I got to the monster under my bed but I cant get past it : You actually got far ! Dang , I congratulate you on that! itâs been a while since I did this game. But it does have six fears! ð Only one more after the one youâre on and than your done . Hint for the monsters under your bed. The exit is the same as the monster. Wonât say more and thank you for playing although itâs old. I did it! that was pretty hard one tip: in your game's settings on itch, you can increase the size of the viewport so that the whole game is visible - right now the bottom of your game is being cut off because the viewport is too short Uhh, how do i do this , this is the second i attempted to put up a game .plus i didn't even notice.

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Hidden Paws It's winter and cats are still outside. Cold and alone. Find them and bring them home. Features 12+ charming winter landscapes with over 120 little cats to find. Open cars and boxes, rummage through piles of wood, search the forests. Cats are well hidden but they meow when you get near so listen closely and you might just be able to find them all. In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $2.99 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. A sweet little game. Soundtrack is excellent, visual style is pleasant too. The mouse controls I wasn't sure about at first but I got used to them (plus there's an invert mouse toggle in the menu). PSA to players: I think it's best played with good stereo headphones, the main way you can tell where cats are is that they meow (only cats you haven't clicked yet will meow idly). Not impossible to play without but I think the best experience is when you do have them. Despite the graphics being on the low poly side, it does seem to ask for a fair amount of juice from my computer while running. This isn't a critisism, just a note to potential players. Mine didn't have a problem (it just made more noise) but another 2 commenters said it ran slow on their system so be aware and check graphic settings if needed. The one thing I did find a little annoying was the trees moving while you simply hovered the mouse over them. Having the environment react to interactions is good and make the game feel more tangible but whenever I would move past a tree, it would russle and I would quickly think this was a cue that there was a cat moving inside. I think the trees should still russle on a click but I don't think hovering should produce a reaction. Also the tree shadows didn't seem perfect on my machine. Chill vibes all around. You don't need to collect all cats and yarn on each level but I felt like I couldn't leave the cats behind. According to the discription above, we are saving them from the cold by finding them, so it would be irresponsible to move on early. I'm pretty sure I'm on Santa's naughty list for opening so many presents that weren't mine to search for cats and yarn in them. But that's a price I'm prepared to pay to save the cats. I enjoyed it, but it runs really slow on my computer. Hmm. I loved the cute look to this game and found it to be very calming. The concept was basic but I feel like it worked well; a sort of hide and seek/Where's Waldo? but with cats. The game's theming is great too, being set during the winter. In my opinion, the controls weren't that bad however I did in some ways find it difficult to find the balls of yarn. I did like how there were sounds to help find the cats which helped me out. Great game in general. Definitely one of my favorite Itch.io games I've played through. I've seen a lot of complaints about controls, but for me, it was simple. W to move, left mouse click to help orient position and right mouse click to look around freely. My only complaints are that I thought visual clues like house indicated specifically which house (oh, this house has two windows next to door) only to realize later it was generic house for hint. I'd love to see more games done with these graphics and play mechanics. Finding aliens on different planets, finding sea creatures, maybe a general wildlife search. The possibilities are endless. Like Hidden Folks, I also loved the mechanic of interacting with environment to find the cats and yarn, opening windows, trunks, flipping over hats and pots, etc. Oh, and the music for the first Christmas level (with presents and such) was beautiful! LOVED this game and love cats. Gave me quite a warm fuzzy feeling and has an air of joyful mystery to it. Nice flow of difficulty not necessarily increasing directly as you go through the levels. One critisism I have is for the lazy people like myself the hints could be done based on visual clue. When you click the hint button you could show a large circle outlining the area which the cat or yarn is in. Well played and made. Jack xox This amazing game is marred by its camera controls, which contribute to motion sickness. Will it get an update for this? I really hope so!! W and S absolutely need an option to move strictly on the X plane, no matter where the camera is pointing. There is currently no option to restrict movement along the X plane (which is weird because the Z axis is handled by Shift and Space and Y is handled by A and D). This would instantly solve everything. I really enjoyed playing this! The controls took a little bit to get used to, but I found that using just the mouse was the best way to maneuver around. Thanks for the cute and relaxing game! ð So relaxing! I actually liked the controls- it added a bit of realism as I couldn't just fly around wherever I wanted. My favorite part was the penguins <3 very cute very cozy but the controls make me almost throw up. Figuring out how to use the mouse by clicking and holding was better - when I tried WSAD controls the game was impossible to play. But still it made me so motion sick I could only finish three levels :'( A really nice and calming experience with a fantastic atmosphere, however the controls were a tad infuriating and sucked me out of the experience every time the camera did not do what I wanted it to. A little sad to know there's an end to this game. I was hoping it was procedurally generated. A wonderful, zen-like experience. Could use a little optimization, but everything else is fantastic. Thank you! This is the most precious game. It's like stepping inside an adorable snow globe. Just finished playing this delightful little game. I loved the little meows so much that I kept finding myself clicking on the cats I'd already found just to make them 'speak'. And the bow-ties on the penguins made me smile. I did have some slight issues with glitchy graphics and sound but that may be due to running it in Wine on a potato (this is a linux-only household). Wasn't bad enough to get in the way of me enjoying the game, though.</TEXT>

ESTA VERSÃO DO PROJETO NÃO REPRESENTA O PRODUTO FINAL. HISTÃRIA No pico na neblina, uma cidade que muitos anos atrÃ¡s nÃ£o passava de uma lugar pacato, agora dava lugar a um local atormentado por acontecimentos e desaparecimentos de pessoas de maneira inexplicÃ¡vel. Em Hidden Memories, o jogador controla Eduardo Mendes ,mais conhecido como Tuca, um jovem que saiu desta cidade interiorana, para se formar na faculdade de Letras, agora, apÃ³s muitos anos resolve voltar para seu local de origem.

Apesar de parecer algo banal, voltar para aquele local era um verdadeiro fardo para Tuca, uma vez que alÃ©m da dificuldade de acesso, aquele era um lugar traumÃ¡tico para o jovem rapaz, uma vez que fora este o ambiente em que sua amiga de infÃ¢ncia Helena sumira de forma misteriosa enquanto brincavam, e mesmo o garoto estando na presenÃ§a dela no momento do ocorrido ele nÃ£o se lembrava de nada, era como se houvesse um borrÃ£o em sua mente.

Trocamos o estilo de movimentaÃ§Ã£o por uma mais clÃ¡ssica do gÃªnero Survival Horror, esperamos que goste! Obs: As animaÃ§Ãµes estÃ£o sendo refeitas para este novo estilo! Semana que vem teremos novidades! JÃ¡ sabem, nÃ©? 32 bit e controle parcialmente adaptado. kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Mas falando serio agora, encontrei 2 bugs no tÃ©rreo da casa, em um deles usando controle de Xbox 360 eu fiquei preso na orientaÃ§Ã£o de uma porta, indo e voltando, morri varias vezes ali. Depois fiquei preso em um canto escuro no tÃ©rreo prÃ³ximo a escada, junto com o monstro. Fora isso os grÃ¡ficos sÃ£o estonteantes para uma beta, realmente incrÃ­veis! Segunda eu tento mostrar os bugs para vocÃªs. Obrigado pelo feedback! No Update ainda desta semana todos os problemas citados serÃ£o corrigidos! Desde jÃ¡ agradecemos o feedback e esperamos que continue jogando, se divertindo e encontrando eventuais bugs!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Hidden Home</TITLE>
<TEXT>Hidden Home is a short thriller game (unfinished) about a man who comes home from a rough day of work, though work won't be the only thing that'll make his life hard after tonight. It might as well be his last. The game was made in Unity together with my girlfriend for a 48h game jam . I did the programming and animated the main character while she made all of the art assets! The sounds effects are from freesounds.org and were edited in Audacity I forgot to change the export settings, so some texture might contain horrible colors. The framerate and dialogue speed are really low for some reason., especially in the HTML5 build. The game only goes up until the point of grabbing the gun. We didn't have time to finish the project.

Also this game looks like its written by a 15 year old trying to act like an adult. Btw, it's really boring that you can't do anything but do what the game tells you to, like, this game is pretty much just an interactive flash animation, not a game. Thanks for playing and commenting! The game was made in 48 hours, it's not finished (the gun part is the final part before we had to hand it in as stated in other replies) and we had no prior experience in creating and writing something like this, so we've got lots to learn. We do plan on remaking the game and giving it the attention and time it needs to become more fun! thanks for the kind response :) Btw, no hate here! just some constructive criticism for your project, i see some potential in here Got the gun. Still tells me to get the gun. Think it's bugged. (I'm using Chrome x64) Thanks for playing and leaving a comment. The game isn't finished, we didn't have anymore time during the game jam it was made for unfortunately. The gun part is the final thing that happens, though something should've popped out and chased you. Sorry for that. We might come back later and finish it up! good ...but short? thank you! I wish we were able to finish it. We only had 48 hours for the game jam... we do plan on finishing it sometime in the near future! Again, thanks for playing and leaving a comment!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Hidden Angel</TITLE>
<TEXT>You are a character that is neither male or female. You wake up in a clearing in the middle of the forest, large white gate far behind you, with large white spires piercing through the treetops beyond. This is an extension of a previous text based game that I was working on in C++ and C# in which you are a fallen angel discovering who you are, and what memories youâve forgotten. This adaption of my story is done using Twine. These were some of my original blueprints/intentions for the game. Allowing for options of multiple paths. Having an inventory of everything youâve collected along your way. Possibly a life bar. Triggering certain outcomes by what youâve previously collected. While much of the story is still being expanded upon, I hope to add more to it. Giving the character a similar good/bad meter was something that I would love to make in the future. Possibly make it a angel/devil meter, haha. Much of this inspiration came. from my love for Dante's Inferno. Having Dante go through the nine levels of hell, remembering certain moments that had happened to either himself and his wife, while also playing a key role in his current state was interesting. Also Stephen King's famous Dark Tower books played a role, as well as movies such as Inception, and Intersteller. Many of these play around with memories, their connections they had at a different point in time, time itself, and the natural order of things. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Help a shelter out with rescuing cats to a loving home. I recommend playing in fullscreen and with some relaxing music in the background. This was made as a birthday gift to my girlfriend who absolutely adores cats. She also loves the very excellent game Hidden Folks (made by Adriaan de Jongh and Sylvain Tegroeg ) that this game is heavily inspired by. If you like the game consider donating to a local animal shelter. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. owo itâs TOO CUTE >:3333 That is soo cute! And the "meows" are 10/10 :D the game is super cute and super fun, but the text is INFURIATINGLY slow, and there is no way to skip Them: "relaxing music" Me: Sososo cute, appreciate the various poses the kitties are drawn in and all of the different meows! Super cute! I loved the little hint descriptions of each cat and the way they all have their own meow! It's very much in the spirit of Hidden Folks to encourage you to click on every one. Donated a fiver to my local shelter in appreciation. Thanks for sharing this with all of us! based on a true story ? o.O Oh my gosh Bubbles gave me so much trouble, I really had to zoom in just to find that rascal but other than that it was absolutely adorable for such a short game. There isn't much story but for such a simple game I think that's fine especially with its simplistic style. Great game and I hope your gf loves it as well!! I now have a hate love relationship with Bubbles. Great game though! <3AAAA SO CUTTTEEEâ¥ï¸â¡âºï¸ a. dor. a. ble. :3 I wish there was more but this was SUPER cute! 10/10 would play again Love it! Are you sharing the source code? Would love to learn how to do a game like this one. Or even maybe sell the source code? Thanks anyway. Sorry for the very late reply. I'm glad you liked it! But I feel that the game is too similar to Hidden Cats for me to release the source, I wouldn't want anyone using my source to actually rip off and make money off that game. Sorry! i love cat's voice!!! so cute THIS IS SO CUTE! Please add more : ) i had so much trouble finding the bubbles cat omg Thanks for the kind words! Bubbles sure is one of the trickier ones, he's got a bit of a unique view :) Super cute and addictive, wish there was more! Thanks! Great playthrough, you really are a cat finding master! :) I've put the wobbly line shader into its own sample project that I've uploaded, it's free to use for anyone who wants it ! Very cool game good sir! Wonderfully designed too. How did you achieve the 'smearing' effect on the environments? Is it done as post-processing for some layers or is it a shader? Thank you! The wobbly lines come from a modified sprite shader I wrote. It samples the sprite image pixels with a noise offset. I've been thinking about posting the source already, I should probably get to doing that. As mentioned above, I finally took some time to actually put the shader in a small sample project, it's available here if you're interested. Thank you for following-up! I will check that out soon. I'm curious to see how that fares with pixel art projects. I can't play with Chrome or Firefox (Mac Os), I don't see the illustrations, just violet square or silhouettes of the elements. That sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. I don't have a Mac myself, I had a friend try it out on his and it worked fine in Chrome, Firefox & Safari. Make sure you've got the latest updates first. Something you can try that might give me some kind of error-message is if you, in Firefox, right-click on the page and choose "Inspect Element". The page should split and show info on the right, at the bottom should be an error log. Reply with any error messages you have there and I'll see what I can figure out. There aren't error messages, but lots of warning. Maybe I found: Warning: Unsupported graphics API WebGL 2.0 So I can play the game, it runs, instead the images are hidden. Thank you anyway I'm sorry to say that it might be that the graphics card on your machine doesn't work with WebGL 2.0. Could be the drivers but if they're up to date already there isn't much I can do to help you out sadly :( Maybe try it out on someone elses mahine? I know my macOs is old. Maybe yes I will try it on another computer. Thank you! I love Hidden cat's graphic, I saw it in a video gameplayer :) bye Pretty cool. I like the voices and sound effects. All the cat pics at the end were a nice touch. Thanks, our cats had to get their due after being featured so prominently in the game :) Very cute. Nice sound design as well! Thanks! As someone who loves Hidden folks and cats...this is purrfect ;) Thank you :) I know it was a birthday present, but I hope you consider expanding the project. It's a really cool way to raise awareness and participation at shelters. Thank you! I really enjoyed hearing your personal stories about your animals, it matched very well with the game :) About expanding it, right now I'm working on other things but maybe sometime in the future I'll go back and add another level or so. Or atleast add some music. This is precious! I love the sounds! Thanks! I really enjoyed this! Great idea for a birthday present. The cat in the bush was a bit tricky to find. We're glad you enjoyed it, we both watched your playthrough. We noticed that it wasn't obvious that you can click the cat names to show some hint-text so we were impressed you found them all by just looking at the silhouettes! Ah, yeah, I had no idea there were hints, that's cool though! Maybe in the tutorial it might help to mention it? But besides the bush cat, it was challenging enough but not too hard. =] The tutorial actually does mention it as you have to click one of the cats and show its info-box to proceed but it seems that it wasn't clear enough :) But I'm glad it was challenging enough still!</TEXT>

<TEXT> ENG: UA: MISSION: CONTROLS : View all posts Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I like the atmosphere and graphics, it is kind of stylish, too. I like your game, so please take this as positive critique, if possible :-) - everything is too small and located at some weird screen position, I believe everything should be at least little bigger and placed always in the center of the screen - in story mode, it's not very clear what to do and where to go - in survival mode, I guess your goal is to survive, but it's not clear how to shoot or even move (in description you say it's arrows, but it's actually WASD, after some 5 or more minutes with your game, I still don't know how to shoot) - some walls look like floor and vice versa, I keep running against walls and because everything is so small, it always takes time to realize (impenetrable tiles should be more distinct so player can immediately see where he can go and where not) Thanks for the feedback - it means a lot to me. how to shoot: point the mouse at the monster and press the left mouse button (if you play from a PC) just tap on the monster (if you're playing with a touchscreen phone), but don't forget - in order to shoot you need to find a weapon, and then the ammo suitable for it. p.s. try to play with the scale - if you hold down the ctrl button and scroll on the mouse, you can zoom in or out. I think there is a bug with controls, I always have to stop moving in order to make cursor react. I am using notebook with touchpad, maybe it behave differently from normal mouse. Thanks for the note - I have never played with a touchpad, only with a mouse or on a smartphone))) ÐÐµ Ð¿Ð»Ð¾Ñ Ð°Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ°, Ð½Ð°Ð¿Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸Ð½Ð°ÐµÑ ÐÐ¶Ð°Ð²Ð° Ð¸Ð³ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸) Ð¡Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð±Ð¾) ÐÐ¾ÐºÐ° Ð·Ð´ÐµÑÑ "Ð²Ð¸ÑÐ¸Ñ" ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ°Ñ Ð²ÐµÑÑÐ¸Ñ - Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÐµÐµ Ð°ÐºÑÑÐ°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¸ ÑÑÐ°Ð±Ð¸Ð»ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð¾Ð´Ð¸ÑÑÑ Ð²Ð¾Ñ Ð·Ð´ÐµÑÑ: hiddenstructure.netlify.app</TEXT>

It's really awesome to be back playing a game from June Studio! There's a style that runs through their games, a style that indicates straight away who you're playing a game by. This one does certainly feel like that, although things are a bit more restricted gameplay-wise. But I think in the context of the game it works perfectly. Taking on the role of Bobby, a human being transported to "paradise" by the quirky AI known as Mother (or MOM, if you're feeling that close to her), we make some conversation choices whilst hurtling in a very futuristic looking car towards our unknown destination. The future world painted here is a bleak one (as is usually the way with stories set ahead of our time), and the conversations with Mother range from the seemingly banal (music tastes) to the downright concerning (terrorism and how to save humanity). It's a great ride, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something they can sit back and watch unfold in front of them (with the chance to swerve the conversation one way or another). Good work again from this studio, always impressive! cool style I enjoyed playing this game !!! Thank you !</TEXT>

She is joined by her Leshin partner, Heremon ir-Caldy, a doctor fascinated by Sofya's magic but fearful it will soon come at the cost of her life. Together, Sofya and Heremon navigate the mysteries and tensions of Vodotsk, the city they intend to make both their hiding place and their home. In "The Fox's Trail", Sofya is hired to track down a missing Leshin with connections to the Human resistance during the occupation. Investigate how you prefer, with over 100 choice points throughout the story. Some will improve your relationship with the characters. Others will provide you critical information.

Glad to see games out of STL too. This game is awesome! The characters are so interesting and I love the queer representation! SPOILER I'm also really proud of myself for figuring out the case early on. When Galkin mentioned the "stench" of the bar I first suspected it and soon after Sofya goes to the bar with Heremon and he mentions something that confirmed my suspicions. Everything after that pointed in that direction and my excitement was bubbling over waiting for Sofya to figure it out. Very satisfying when it all came to it's conclusion. leshin? as in those monsters from the witcher? giant forest protectors from slavic folklore? The term Leshy is indeed a deity of the forest from Slavic folklore, which is also referenced in the Witcher series. Our Leshin are definitely a nod to such folklore, but take a very different spin on it, and are more similar to elves in most traditional fantasy. This is reeeeally good ! I love the characters, and the plot had some excellent twists and turns. Sofya and Heremon have such a great dynamic and the voice acting throughout is superb. Big kudos on the music too. Really looking forward to episode 2! Ohh, the art is beautiful. I just wish the game had a male protagonist as well:(</TEXT>

<TITLE>Echoes of the Fey Episode 0: The Immolation</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Imagine being the only survivor of an explosion that kills thousands of people. That is the fate of Sofya Rykov. And survival is just the beginning of her tale... Episode 0: The Immolation is a free, standalone chapter in the Echoes of the Fey visual novel series. This installment serves as an introduction to players new to the series and provide important backstory to players who enjoyed Echoes of the Fey Episode 1: The Fox's Trail , already released on Steam. Play as Sofya Rykov, before she became a private investigator and before she was cursed with unstable magic powers. An officer in the Imperial Army, Sofya is tasked with guarding Leshin prisoners at Onigrad, a city which will soon become famous for its fiery destruction. In the last days of the long war between Humans and Leshin, a tense stalemate emerges amidst the chaos. For years, Leshin have lain siege to the Humans over their use of Fey reactors, massive machines that draw electricity from the realm of magic. Both sides tire after almost thirty years of war, and perhaps peace is now in reach. But Leshin extremists, desperate for a victory to reclaim their power among the people, are about to stage a devastating attack that will change the world forever. Echoes of the Fey is a series of detective stories set in the high fantasy world of Oraz. Episode 0: The Immolation takes place before the protagonist, Sofya Rykov, becomes a private investigator. She is an officer in the Imperial Human army who believes she has secured a safe position as a prison guard in the metropolitan city of Onigrad. One fateful night, one of the Leshin assigned to her begins to act strangely. And then a massive boom rings out from the Onigrad Fey reactor... Episode 0 is an adventure game/visual novel with dialog trees and several choices for Sofya that will affect the way the story plays out. Sofya will also be able to explore the prison and learn more about the world from her prisoners, though with an impending disaster about to hit the prison, she will have to balance how to use her time before staging her escape.

<TITLE>Echoes of the Fey: The Last Sacrament$13.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows **FULL GAME NOW RELEASED!** The Echoes of the Fey series mixes a high fantasy setting with the mysteries and conspiracies of pulp detective fiction. Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she is the only Human able to wield unlimited magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot. Developed in Unreal Engine 4, The Last Sacrament forms the next installment of the ongoing series. Sofyaâs loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofyaâs childhood love and the Emperorâs daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerinaâs rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city—and Sofyaâs heart. Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofyaâs life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story. You can also pursue romances with four different characters in The Last Sacrament: Heremon, Arkady, Nikolai, or Katerina. -------------------------------------------------- Recommended MINIMUM requirements on LOW settings: Microsoft Windows 7 or higher AMD 7500 or NVIDIA GT 555M video card 4GB RAM Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz 2 GB free hard drive space In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $13.99 USD.

I bought this on steam but it doesn't work when I try to save my game or press continue so I was wondering if I could get an activation key to install it from this site and see if it works better? I'm really enjoying the game and would love to continue playing it. Hey Sam! As I mentioned on Steam, it sounds like an important save file got corrupted. You can purge your saves from this folder: C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\EotF_Sacrament\Saved\SaveGames (replace [USERNAME] with your own username on your computer) to start again fresh. I also pushed an update here and on Steam this morning that I hope will provide an extra fail-safe from something like this happening again. Will this be available on Mac at some point? Unfortunately we don't expect to release on Mac; apologies! My antivirus says that files of this game may be infected by virus, so I can't play it. Please, check it. Hi MrMar, Unfortunately this is very common for indie games before they have been played by a widespread audience. The antivirus software simply does not recognize the program. The files are safe, and you can still play if you tell your antivirus to ignore them (or if needed, you can temporarily disable your antivirus). Just played the demo, so here are my first impressions; The little mini game is interesting and definitely a leap in an unique direction. The only issues I had were that changing in actions with a mouse (going from Moving Action to Trap Action for example) were a little janky, with Moving often becoming automatic. Otherwise, very interesting and look forward to see how you up the difficulty and make it challenging later in the game. I'm digging the living backgrounds from the two scenes there is in the demo, and while in the screenshots the depth perception is a little weird in the city-view, in scripted bits it looks lovely! Very pleased to see character animations and interactions with my boy Heremon are staying true, and Kat looks like she's going be a very interesting addition to Sofya's upcoming story! (Plus in the last game I was very much angling for a Sofya-Heremon mutual interest, and having a bit of real romance drama will give me LIFE.) I usually make saves when Choices come up, so I can quickly pop back and change the choice if I change my mind, but script froze when I tried to load back and test how the save system was- it returned to normal when I loaded the auto-save and picked the first choice with Heremon, so I guess saving on the Choice screen doesn't work... Overall, I've got a positive feeling about this game, and I am reeeally looking forward to seeing how you go forward with it. While all the animation and mini-games might not be why I'll play it, and more for just how much I'm loving Sofya and her story, I'm still supporting the decision and hope you have fun experimenting with your new tech :) Good luck! You have an eager customer with me! Thanks so much for these notes, @queenbol! We're looking forward to sharing the final result with everyone in a few months :D</TEXT>

<TITLE>Crimson Spires - DEMO</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows The full game is NOW RELEASED and available here: https://woodsy-studio.itch.io/crimson-spires ______ The small mining town of Bataille, Missouri has been cordoned off from the outside world for six months. The inhabitants have no idea why. All they know is that ever since the so-called "Contingency," planes no longer fly overhead, strange creatures have been glimpsed beyond the perimeter, and large mechanical towers will gun down anyone who tries to escape. As Sheriff Erika Wright searches for the truth, she must listen to the advice of a serial killer, mingle with extreme conspiracy theorists, and negotiate with vampires. As Erika struggles to maintain order in Bataille, she uncovers startling secrets and makes unlikely alliances. Eventually, she must choose a partner in her quest to find the truth. The story will have four completely unique story branches depending on Erika's partner, each of which reveals a new secret and a chance for Erika to find romance. Adopted by the Bataille family at a young age, Liam Bataille has always struggled to feel like he fits in with the family. Heâs easily the nicest member of the Batailles with an optimistic attitude, and he regularly urges to Erika to relax and have fun. But his loyalty is frequently torn between his personal virtue and his desire to please Julian and Charlotte. Before the towers rose, August Flynn was a philosophy professor accused of 7 murders, coined the âHeartbreakerâ for removing the victimsâ hearts. Erika doesnât believe his claims of innocence, but she might need his expertise against darker forces. Growing up as a lesbian in a conservative, rural town often made Maddy Gray feel like an outsider in her own home. The Batailles were the only people who fully accepted her, so she feels loyal to them. But as she learns the real truth of the Batailles, sheâll have to fight for the greater good. Julian Bataille seems calm, polite, and practical on the surface. He claims to maintain order in Bataille with his wealth and influence. He does like to maintain order and peace. But is he actually manipulating everyone for his own personal gain? Extract the zip folder, open it, then run the CS_Demo.exe or CrimsonSpires_Demo.exe to launch the game. -------------------------------------------------- Recommended MINIMUM requirements on LOW settings: Microsoft Windows 7 or higher AMD 7500 or NVIDIA GT 555M video card 4GB RAM Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz 2 GB free hard drive space Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I've bought a lot of your games... But not this one. Because there is no Linux port. :,( THIS IS SO GOOOOOD!!1! I really enjoyed the demo! :D Just wondering how long the full game is? This game immediately had my attention with the description and the art style, but it's been sitting in my, "Want to Play," list for awhile. I finally downloaded it, started it up and played through both demos tonight. The beginning demo had me HOOKED. The music along with the environment had me creeped out, but I wanted to know more. By the end of the beginning demo I just yelled, "WHAT?" The middle demo had me asking questions too, and I'm so excited to play through the full release. I can't wait!! I had to go explain all of it to my husband and now we are conspiring and making theories as to what is actually going on. This is going to be amazing and I can't wait to see if any of our theories are right or if we're completely wrong. The writing is well done and I love the characters already, with August being my favorite so far. I'm looking forward to the release!! :) I loved the demo i cant wait for the full release. Is that still planned for september or has the plan changed? I love your art style and the scary and suspenseful vibe of the game ive never seen anything like it. :) Thanks so much! We're aiming for Oct 27 okay Thankyou I cannot wait for the full game. Will the full game cost any money cause either way I will get it just wondering :) The new release date is Oct 27th! We really hope this one will stick :D Was there a Meramec Caverns billboard before?! I may have just overlooked it the first time, but that little detail is just perfect. If you have time, can you explain what's extended? This demo seems to end in the same place as it did a year ago? Still very excited for it. Haha thanks; I think it was there before, but I'm glad you enjoyed it. Malcolm and I see those often driving around Missouri! The extended version includes the "Middle" demo option, which allows you to play another segment of the game and meet more characters. There is currently no option to play straight through, though. Hopefully that will be available in a few months with the full game! XD Aw, sweet! I saw that, but I forgot it by the time I got to the end of the first bit. I'll go look at that as soon as I'm off work then. :) I can't download the demo. After pressing install nothing happens. I'm quite curious about this game . Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry you're experiencing this issue. Currently, both versions are available for download (the titles have "v1" or "Extended" suffix). Hopefully we can fix the extended demo errors soon. is this the latest demo? on their steam page they mentioned something about festival demo, can somebody elaborate on that? We have added the latest demo here to itch, although it sounds like some people are having issues installing and playing. Currently, both versions are available for download (the titles have "v1" or "Extended" suffix). Hopefully we can fix the new demo errors soon. I'm having problems with the new demo. It will not install with the itch.io app. at all. It attempts to install for a few seconds and then just stops with no error message. I'm running on a windows 10 64 bit os. Intel i5-7500 cpu, 16 gb ram and Radeon rx 460 gpu. I can get the downloaded and unzipped demo to run but it doesn't seem to be the extended demo. It gives the option to start the demo from the beginning or the middle and if I start at the beginning, the demo ends just after August says "I believe we're surrounded." The demo then says 'to be continued' and goes straight to the credits roll. I can then restart and choose to play from the middle but then I have no idea what has led up to that point. The demo seems to be missing content or not running it correctly. I uninstalled and purged all the saved games and references to the previous Crimson Spires demo, before playing the current demo, so I'm not sure what's going wrong. I'm sorry to hear you had these issues! Thanks for providing these details. We're investigating the problem now. I was able to download the demo through the itch website, but it's very glitchy. I had intially thought it was broken (the screen was stuck on just a blank, black screen) but I waited and the game did eventually load but there was a LOT of lag reading through the dialogue and with transitions (new characters/sprites appearing, and every scene transition got stuck at the black screen again). I finally gave up at the first investigation screen wen the dialogue box didn't load correctly after examining the bloodstain. I'm sorry to hear you had these issues! We're investigating the problem now. Can you tell me whether your computer meets the minimum spec requirements (added to download & install instructions)? I don't see the spec requirements on this page, but it's Windows 10 64 bit, 8 GB RAM, 3.10 GB processor so I would think it should... I'm trying to download the update in the itch app and I keep getting an error: unsupported compression algorithm (not sure what that means). I can't wait to play the full game! ð Do you guys think the full game will be Mac supported? I really want to play but I don't have access to a windows OS :/ Have you tried using Boot Camp? I'm really looking forward to this game and I was hoping to play the new demo. Has the demo been updated here yet? I am very excited about this game and been looking forward to the new demo since the announcement on your twitter. Though, from what I can tell it has not been updated yet, am I correct? Also, do you have a Discord channel? Thank you, Endraca! The new demo release has been pushed to June 16. We do have a Discord channel here: discord.gg/j5BYj2W Definitely intrigueing set-up with the mystery spires and horror-esque place Erika and company have found themselves in. I reallyadored August's character. Keep up the good work and can't wait for this game's release <3 I am completely in awe of this demo. With such little game play you have me hooked and I can't wait to play more! Loved it! I cannot wait for the full release!!!! That was amazing, i really like the vibe and the characters, especially August;). i'll wait patiently for the full game I NEED THE FULL GAME PLEASE !!!! i was so shocked at the end and the heavy atmosphere is so cool i really liked it !! GOOD JOB !! Cant wait for it !! i have no idea what's going on and this is so cool and different and weird and JOOOOONNESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Hi! Absolutely LOVED the demo. Is this game still in development? Do you guys happen to have a Pateron I could contribute to? It's still in development! Altough the release is pushed back to summer 2020. Here's an update from the studio blog: http://woodsy-studio.com/news/summer-update/ We currently don't have the equipment to build the game on Mac, but we'll update if anything changes The demo is incredible. The atmosphere,characters,graphic and music,all the part're GREAT. I'm glad I found this game,can't wait to see the full game! I just finished the demo. The engine... UE4 - rare in indie games, especially the story based ones Great, deep and dark atmosphere. Very good thriller & horror vibes. Very good graphic side and music. Well-done 3d backgrounds and explorable surroundings + dialoques based on beautiful, 2d character sprites and texboxes. Partial voice acting was good idea. But i have found few flaws: on the explorable part, I was able to walk throu my car and the trees, the shadows/lightining inside the van seemed to be a bit bugged. These are, of course, only small, not important details. Few interesting, different, well-written characters. Begenning for great story. I'm waiting for more â¥ Very spooky. I love it and look forward to more :> I finally had time to play the demo and I LOVE it. The atmosphere is so creepy and great but without causing anxiety. I have thoughts about the why of the spires and I'm looking forward to seeing if I'm even remotely correct. Excited to meet the other characters too. :) (Also I may have just spent a long time looking at records of mining that could fit the "I just drove through Perryville" description to try and mentally decide where I would put your fictional town...) I haven't even downloaded the demo yet and I'm excited! If at any point you want to add details about mining in Missouri, I'm your gal! Ohh awesome, we might have to take you up on that... The demo is amazing and I'm happily looking for the full game))) Loved all of yours other games too! That's great to hear, thank you :D Wow! I'm intrigued!! Thanks! Very interesting demo and I'd love to play the full game. Is there a way to pre-order (like a minimum donation to get the full game on release)? Thank you very much! There currently isn't a way to pre-order but I will look into ways to make that possible :D Thanks for the feedback! I think the glitch you mentioned is actually just a result of how we staged the scene. We are considering ways to make that less confusing. At this point we're hoping for a fall or winter release date this year. The game will probably be 200,000-300,000 words, but it's hard to say for sure as we're still writing some of the branches! Probably no Kickstarter but we might try Indiegogo. I love almost everything about the demo! The art, the music, atmosphere, and especially the plot and 3D graphics! Erika also seems like a fantastic MC and I'm curious to see how her relationships with the other characters will unfold. One thing I had a bit of trouble with was the settings menu. Although I set the text speed to max, the text still appeared very slowly on my screen. I also had to click multiple times on the setting adjustment bars and save and load buttons to save or load my game because it didn't register during the first click. Otherwise, this seems like a great game and I'm impatient to play more of it! Really looking forward to the final product and wish your team all the best in its making! Thanks for the feedback! We'll definitely take a look at those settings I just played the demo and I am VERY intrigued! Can't wait for more! Thank you!</TEXT>

Reuben <3 hello! ^^ i played the original game back as a teenager, and Serafina's Crown when I was in college! I loved both so this release is really exciting to me hehe, I'll have to play it ASAP :) I was looking for the original Serafina's Saga a bit ago and was really sad to see it wasn't available anymore slkfjdsklfj so I'm glad that this was the reason! (Speaking of - the itch.io page for Serafina's Crown still links to the old (broken) link for the original game! It might be good to replace it for any players looking on that page ^^) Thank you for letting me know, Zelan! I will go fix that link now. Congratulations! You make game on Unreal Engine , right? Thank you! Yes, UE4 Holy.... crap! I didnt know you guys were making another Serafina game! I remember downloading the original game and falling in love with it then when I saw the second installment, I bought it on steam and played it and loved it as well! I seriously can't wait for this remake! Thanks so much. I hope you enjoy it! This looks promising; I can't wait for the full game. Best of luck for u guys Thank you! is there a possibility of arken being added as a love interest? He remains a father figure to Serafina in this game. However, he can become a love interest for Odell in Serafina's Crown ;) yay</TEXT>

<TITLE>Serafina's Crown$7.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Seven years after the events of Serafina's Saga , Grand Prince Robil Feldren dies of illness -- and a few weeks later, Queen Belatrix Grandil dies in in the midst of a "hunting accident." Serafina Elborn and her husband Reuben Jeridar are poised to take the throne, except for one big problem: many nobles suspect that Reuben Jeridar arranged the assassination of Belatrix Grandil. Players take on the role of Odell Perin, who is unwittingly thrust into a position of power. Due to her neutral stance, Odell Perin is elected to serve as Regent long enough to settle the ongoing disputes -- and thus determine who will become the next King or Queen of Darzia. Serafina's Crown is a visual novel with elements of fantasy, adventure and romance. Every decision Odell makes as Regent of Darzia will change the story arc to favor different gods. These decisions will get Odell closer to solving the murder, but they can also make things more complicated for the inexperienced ruler ... The game also features a debate system that allows Odell to argue points in court based on the stats she has earned throughout the game. Winning debates furthers Odell's quest in securing the next monarch of Darzia. In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $7.99 USD.

<TITLE>miraclr - Divine Dating Sim$9.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux miraclr is a comedic workplace romance starring the biblical (and apocryphal) archangels, told in an office collaboration app. Play as a human recruited to assist the archangels of heaven with the creation and implementation of the first true miracle in over 400 years.

As you get closer to the angels, they might choose to grace you with images of themselves. Images you obtain in the game can be used to change the characters' avatars, and also become available from the main menu gallery. Your choices affect your relationship with each angel, and those relationships significantly impact the plot! Once you choose a miracle, the plot branches into six possible story-lines, with their own good and bad endings! Play the game multiple times if you want to experience the full script of over 100,000 words. Choose from 12 illustrated avatar options, enter your name, and create a female, male, or non-binary character.

The game seems fun and the character dynamics even more so, but I'm on day 4 and find the real-time aspect a bit of a hit-or-miss. Unfortunately, mostly miss so far, due to reasons I'll describe in a second. I usually don't play games with those mechanics due to work but being able to adjust the schedule to fit around mine is an amazing feature, the only problem being it tends to not work as intended - I'd set the midday meeting to after 3pm just to open the game not long after and not seeing any new interactions, just to return an hour later (still within the timeframe) to see multiple missed meetings with timestamps of 11am for mid-day and 3:30 pm for evening, despite the evening one being set to after 9pm. Having to constantly rewind to reply is a bit of a hassle, and if I'm not mistaken the relationship hits don't really reset? I'm not sure what's causing the meetings to not trigger correctly, if you have any tips on that it'd be much appreciated. Luckily, I'm starting my holiday tomorrow so I've decided to start a new game and give it another go, with the default meeting times this time. I've enjoyed what I've seen of the plot so far and I'm definitely looking forward to finishing</TEXT>

Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything theyâd ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way sheâs never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she canât explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond sheâs felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigailâs death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves. A part-time manager, part time video editor, and full-time babysitter, Maddie has the thankless job of handling the absolute whirlwind that is her best friend. Sheâs professional, meticulous and intellectual; the first person to turn to when a problem needs solving. But when their investigation entangles her in an ancient curse, she's forced to confront phenomena beyond her comprehension, and more importantly, her own self doubt. For the last two centuries, the ghost of a young woman has haunted the forests of Eysenfeld. That ghost is Abigail, a kind and playful soul forcibly bound to the forest as part of an ancient curse. Two hundred years of wishing for a life cruelly denied to her have led to a feeling of crushing loneliness and one overwhelming desire: to finally have someone to talk to. One of the worldâs most popular paranormal vloggers (according to her), Tara is unfailingly charismatic and bursting with limitless energy. Sheâs brash, intrepid, and always seeking something new. That often makes her a magnet for trouble: whether itâs from relentless flirting, minor criminal activities or just plain pig-headedness, things around Tara have a tendency to end in chaos. A loyal Taranormal viewer and the daughter of Eysenfeldâs mayor, Morgan is… different. When not running her small and mostly empty antique shop, sheâs known to disappear into the woods for days at a time. That, combined with her resistance to traditional social standards, has caused her to develop a bit of a notorious reputation in the village. However, this resistance is not just an act of rebellion: Morgan knows that thereâs something sinister deep within Eysenfeld, and sheâs not going to stop until she tears it out at the roots. â Incredible character and CG art from Rosuuri â Fully original backgrounds and soundtrack â Approximately 130,000 words with multiple endings â Ending theme from In Love With A Ghost â Multiple accessibility options, and fully translated to Traditional Chinese (ç¹é«ä¸­æ), Simplified Chinese (ç®ä½ä¸­æ), German (Deutsch), and Spanish (EspaÃ±ol) â Extra features including a music room, CG viewer, and guest art gallery â At least one really, really gay ghost Optional R18 Patch The R18 patch (â» available for free ) adds two additional scenes of uncensored, explicit R18 sexual content to the game. â» This content is purely optional — you can still enjoy the full story without the patch. â» WARNING: This patch is intended only for adults 18 years of age or older and contains content which some players might find offensive.

So much that I feel petty saying this but I wish there was just, even a tiny mention of Tara's transgender status being canon. I know it's a yuri, wlw focused game and not everybody is going to rejoice in what I'm seeing, but Tara's just, well, I can't put in words how much it means to see another wlw transwoman, and one who you chose, so touchingly, to portray as normal, beautiful, accepted, loving and beloved. I shouldn't even be kvetching about this this given how far you're going with the voicework, and I can't laud you enough for to hire a trans VA to dub Tara. Which again means so much that I can't even put here. I just want you to know how much Tara means to folks like me. Anyway all that doesn't take away from your creative freedom, this is your project, thank you so much for all your work.</TEXT>

People will be more likely to play your game as well if you download the WebGL support to play it in browser. But there can be some performance issues with that, so test it out first if you do that. Let me know if you choose to port it to either so I can play and rate your game! If you want to play and rate my game, itâs a goofy dungeon crawler where every choice will impact the story.

Thanks :D Just download the installer and execute :D Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Good game, fun and intriguing. Congratulations on the development Game was hard to play, movement is slow, footsteps are very loud and the noise is bad, never saw the monster. Nice game to play with friends on potato PC! But I think the flashlight is kinda bad Nice game! It was so alarming, I didn't get to see the monster (My friend did tho) and even tho, the game still had a terrifying ambience, where the red square simply takes control on your decisions. On the other hand, it didn't have a proper ending, and the monster/indigo, was just a little too slow. Loved the style, and it runs amazingly in my potato PC, don't stop making more content! Thanks for the great game! Terrible, don't bother downloading IDK my windows just said no no no</TEXT>

I played the demo on Steam, and it's a neat game, but every time it goes from a day to a section to a night or vice versa, the FPS gets super bad, like almost unplayable. i hope to see the full release! <3 Tried to run this a few times, but it is just super slow and bad fps, maybe just for me but my computer is not bad at this point, so idk but it seems fun, i'll wait until i can play this properly.. edit Tried installing on steam and got the same problem cool demo I tried to run this game a few times, unfortunately it ran super slow with bad fps, I'm running it through a gtx 1650 graphics card and it still runs slow, very sorry, the game looks great, I just cant play it I tried both through Itch and Steam, but the game just stops responding once I finish the intro cut scene. Fun idea, I always enjoy the whole survive with a limited amount of power type of game. However, there are some clipping especially with the walls and fireplace. And the control menus aren't up for long enough to see what to do. I had to restart the game multiple times to see the instructions for how to clean the window and survive the night (for example). You should put the controls in settings. The pros are the overall ambiance of the game. I was scared to leave the cabins, even at daytime. The footsteps really add to the whole spooky feel, at any second something could come running up to you and I love that feeling. The idea was generally cool and I was excited to see what would happen with his sister. This is an awesome concept, just got here from your video on how you made the day time section scarier than the night time. Can't wait to try it out! I'm gonna buy it when I have enough money some day, keep up the good work!</TEXT>

Eh... I felt bored in few minute then for a moment enjoyed safe zone then bored again and quit. Sorry. Make it more dynamical please. This game is free and was made in like 2 days. I'm finished with this small project. it's not a game you're not meant to blast through, it's a slow methodical game, that requires you to use the map in the safe house and keen-eyed exploration to spot landmarks and avoid the gods in the woods. It's also not linear, it's an open-world style game, so pacing is really up to you. Yeah, I know. I play many "slow" games like this. Anyway - it's my opinion. Really enjoyed this game. As always, your atmosphere is super on point. You make games that are easy to get lost in, which I assume is intended. I really appreciated the message of this game, and I would love to see more devs get personal with their art like this. Excellent job, looking forward to whatever's next! Just finished it up and enjoyed it, nice work! Thanks for playing man, Glad to hear you enjoyed it! For the most part, I enjoyed the game and I'll keep an eye on other games that might come out from the studio. Here's my channel for other games I have played. https://www.youtube.com/c/Levont No-commentary playthrough: Thanks so much for playing! Glad you liked it! This was such a cool game for something that was made in just a few days. Without spoiling the behind-the-scenes story (I'll leave that for others to discover/interpret), the environments were great! Detailed in the right areas and a decent-sized map that I never felt lost in. The creature design is really well thought out along with the ambiance and music. The voice acting is really good and I felt really invested in the game when playing. A great, short experience that everyone will enjoy. Good job, looking forward to your next game. Aaron</TEXT>

<TITLE>Starwood Hollow$2.50</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows This is a very early version of Starwood Hollow — fully playable, but far from the complete vision we have planned. Over time, Weâll be adding new content, features, and polish, and with each major update, the price will increase. By getting in early for just $1.00, youâll not only help support development, but youâll also receive the full finished game at no extra cost — all it takes is a bit of patience while we bring Starwood Hollow to its full glory! Step into the enchanted world of Starwood Hollow , a challenging 2D action-platformer where every shadow hides a threat and survival is earned, not given. You play as a brave alien wanderer, stranded in a mysterious woodland where cosmic horrors and relentless creatures stand in your way. This is a game of high-stakes combat and precision platforming. You must master your abilities to survive waves of mischievous enemies, overcome devious traps, and confront the powerful guardians that await you at the end of each stage. Can you conquer the hollow, or will it claim you as another forgotten soul? Whether youâre a casual player looking for a charming adventure or a hardcore gamer seeking a true challenge, Starwood Hollow offers a journey for dreamers and fighters alike.

<TITLE>Blemish Visual Novel (Demo)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Coming soon to Kickstarter on August 1, 2017! Follow Pavior on the Twitter for updates! Blemish is a psychological drama visual novel game with suspense elements. The game will consist entirely of first-person narration and dialogue between characters. There will be pivotal choices that will change the outcome of the story. Tobias Gamble is a family therapist whom various married couples recommend to others in the small city of Flanston. He's praised for his familiar way of association and candidly speaking on his own experiences as a married individual. Having little doubt in his career, Tobias yields a proud and charismatic nature, at least until after he associates with his first adolescent patient. Zoe Matthews , the patient in question, is found dead in her bedroom after committing suicide. It isn't long before the event becomes gossip throughout the city, and Tobias' composure is left shattered. Wallowing in guilt, he trudges along to his next patient, another young girl by the name of " Millicent ." Tobias commences the assessment disheartened and distrustful of his ability, and he'll soon find there's little rest to be had. Credits Download the . zip file and extract it to your directory of choice, then run the BlemishDemo.exe in the resulting folder. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Are you by any chance looking for a portuguese translation for ur game? This was awesome! It may have been the first visual novel I've ever read, and I was so sucked in! Keep at it, I wanna see the finished version. It was REALLY good! I would totally play a game like this, but the demo is way too short and uneventful to judge the future project. Music is nice, the concept is great, art is great - it's funny how both Tobias and Millicent disliked how the children's hospital looks, while the screenshot of it was the first thing to catch my eye on this page. The writing is also nice, although a bit... much at times ("undelight"? "peaceable"?) Overall, though, your game's page seems a bit abandoned, which is a pity - I wish this game does get made one of these days. Wow, it looks very nice. Wow,awesome game! hello Pavior, do you have a gmail account I could contact you on? I may have a potential collaboration proposition I wanted to run by with you. goodluck on completing this! Thanks, JP! Such a fascinating premise. The demo kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. Looking forward to future updates, and good luck with the kickstarter campaign! I'm delighted to hear that. Thanks so much for trying it out!</TEXT>

So sorry to hear that. The payment process isn't something I have any control over so unfortunately I can't help you there, but I'm glad you got your money back at least. I'm sure u earned alot of money but i do wish it was free but thats ok. I'm proud of this pack. I put time and effort into these backgrounds so I don't think there is anything wrong with expecting payment for them. And I definitely didn't make a lot of money from it lol I love ur work but thank u for telling me :) Thank you for understanding! :D Hello Selavi Games! Thanks a lot for the BG pack, I just bought it and think it's really cool! I'll use it on my game. I just have some question: do you have the file "hallway school" without the "Go Hawks" text? and also the "school entrance" files without the "Maple Park High School" text? If so, could you please send me? Thanks a lot for the pack and attention. Wish you success! Hi! I added the backgrounds without text to the pack and released it as a new version, 1.31. I didn't have the entrance BG without the plaque entirely, if that's what you meant, but you should be able to place whatever text you want there now. Hope you'll find them useful! Hello! Thanks a lot for the answer and updated version with new files. Keeping the plaque is okay, I just wanted to give me game's school a different name, that's all. Thanks a lot for the great work and support! Wish you al the happiness and success in the world! :D Would you consider adding a night version of the living room and the kitchen? I can find many day versions, but finding night apartment bgs is hard (and I can't use any day only version; all VNs have also evening scenes at home). Some of the backgrounds in this pack are older and I don't have the original files for them anymore. I do commissions though if you'd like something to suit your project. I'd like to use this for a personal project. Thank you very much for making these! I will credit you of course Glad to hear they are useful to you and thank you for crediting me :) Hi, i'd like to look at including your assets in a project but I need to clarify a few things. Can you please provide me with an email address - my contact is jon.silvera@fuze.co.uk Many thanks I'm bookmarking this since prolly gonna purchase later! :D These are so lovely! I'll definitely keep them in mind to use later!</TEXT>

I am just starting to learn Renpy and I would appreciate if you can help me with coding the UI and script. I saw your commission page and sent you an email, but I haven't got a response yet Hello(OvO)ã, about the commission, it is actually not available now since the slots are currently full. You can check here or on my website to see when it will be open again (/ I will have time again). Due to current projects, I probably wonât be able to accept any new commissions until next May, but if yours is just a small one, you can send me an email to discuss. I donât know why but I didnât receive your email. >o< Can you send it again? Is Point Pop Up Template, Name Input Screen and this template a bundle? I see they are on sale, how can I buy them together? Thank you for buying them! Iâm not sure if you still need an answer anyways, I havenât created any bundles yet (If I didnât press anything wrong www) so theyâre not a bundle. (ï½¥Ïï½¥) Awesome template! Also just so you know for screen navi_menu() the code: hotspot (1218, 757, 532, 168) action ShowMenu("main_menu") should be replaced with hotspot (1218, 757, 532, 168) action MainMenu() instead, or else it causes issues like when you click on any of the screens in the main menu like preference and press the exit button it takes you to the game screen where you left it off last time, rather than back to main menu! It also caused issues for me where it didn't correctly reset all variables from the old game when starting new game when you return to the menu from it! Hope this helps! I am using the $4, so not sure if it's already solved in the $8 version. Hi! Thanks for the comment. I didnât know it will caused this issue Sorry for the inconvenience caused >o< I edited the code and re-uploaded the file If you spot anything else or have other problem, feel free to let me know. I Like your style Hi I have bought this template, can you help me to customize it? (Like adding a logo, and some extra screens) I sent you an email! Sure! How come you can't download it anymore? I really want to use this. Is there a reason it's not available or am I doing something wrong? It should still be downloadable if you bought it before.

<TITLE>Visual Novel Game</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Haraya Games is Making a Visual Novel this time. NEED YOUR HELP! Patreon Support -Donate (with benefits, see attached files for more info) -Music -CG artist -Graphics Currently, it is on-going, but the Alpha might be finished SOON ( oh-yeah!) . This visual novel will be divided into few chapters so that we can enjoy the game as soon as possible. Characters Anton - he is the owner of a small cafe in town. A gentle heart that he is, he easily become friends with others-including Danielle. Although he seemed to be a happy person, he raises his brother alone and keeps his problems to himself. He has a good reputation in town for his optimism and caring personality. Anton is the protagonist ( player character ) in the game. Play as Anton and dive in deep within the game by getting the connection (AVAILABLE in Chapter 1) Danielle - she is a girl who just moved into the town after a tragedy that happened to her family. She is living alone in her apartment: current job and social status unknown. One day, while she was taking a stroll, she passed by a small garden. Not knowing that it was owned by someone, she went inside and rested. There she met Anton -the owner of the garden and the cafe beside it. Little-by-little, Anton will discover more about her, her past and YOU as a player might unravel Anton's connection to this woman. What kind of person might Danielle be? What secrets does she hide? Is she a friend or the other way around? Shall we find out? (AVAILABLE in Chapter 1) Umber - he is the younger brother of Anton. Umber is a sweet guy; a studious teenager who loves to help his brother first and foremost. He is as gentle as his older brother, although not as confident and as bubbly as he is. He is sickly, but very determined about being successful in life-by doing well in school. Find out more about his connection on how he could change the ending of the game. (AVAILABLE in Chapter 1) A draft of Umber Jasmine - another yet mysterious girl surrounded by mystery. She loves children, although she might not look like it for her chill and young personality. (NOT AVAILABLE in Chapter 1) Olive - he is bubbly and his confidence is striking. He can easily intimidate anyone with his good looks, intelligence, and job position, but only one person can make him go crazy-Danielle. Olive might be generous (or dangerous?), but how big could his secrets be? What past did he have with Danielle? How connected is he with the rest of the characters? (AVAILABLE in Chapter 1) Raymond - an entrepreneur by heart, and a bookworm by nature. Raymond is yet another quiet, but approachable personality. Once you know him, you might fall in love with his eloquence and gentle heart. Having that persuasive personality, people easily trust him. A friend of Danielle that he is even before Anton seem to be a threat to Anton in " some" ways. Although he seem harmless, what could he really be? Is he even a real man or a wolf hiding in a sheep's skin? ( AVAILABLE in Chapter 1) MORE CHARACTERS (for the upcoming chapters) Charm - Oh, what a bubbly child! Niko the Vendor - the local (something )vendor. Father (of someone in the game) - discovering the past! Company employer - a friend of someone (a witness-finally!) and MORE.....so stay tune!</TEXT>

Hey I just had a quick question for you. I'm planning on making and selling my own sprites that have similar attributes to yours (i.e. Thighs up, mix match expressions, multiple outfits and such) and I wanted to know how often you get sales and/or if this is profitable. I don't want to ask, "How much do you make?" but I'd just like to know if you have regular sales (No need to give exact number). Sorry if this is an odd question, I'm just looking into different avenues for my art career. ä¸­å½å¼åè ï¼ç¨æ¨çç«ç»å¶ä½äºä¸ä¸ªæå­åé©æ¸¸æï¼è°¢è°¢ï¼éå¸¸æ£çç´ æï¼ç«ç»éå¸¸åç»ï¼ https://store.steampowered.com/app/985740/__Cohabitation_Guide/</TEXT>

I even think of Agustina as my "lab-partner" in a way ;-) Heya. I used your asset in my game here (you don't have to play it, it's not very good). Oh my, I am so in love with your art... I already was with cute demon crasher but it's so cuuuute. This is so excellent and professional! Incredibly well done~ If you consider this "simple", what do you consider complex? ð The art is so cute! Cool Very cute!!!!! I'm not sure I understand the license.

<TITLE>Visual Novel Busts plugin for RPG Maker MV$14.39-10%</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool This plugin adds bust support to RPG Maker MV's message system. You can control all bust functions from either the Show Text event command itself or through Script Calls. This plugin supports one bust on the Message Window and ten other busts on the screen behind it. Busts can move, fade in and out, change opacity, slide in and out, mirror themselves, change scale, and have tones applied to them. While some of these options can be done through Show Picture event commands, having too many pictures on the screen can cause performance dips. By making busts separate sprites from pictures, there are less issues, too. Screen busts are located behind pictures. The message bust is located in front of the Message Window but behind the Message Window's text. Since the Message Window is located above pictures, that means the message bust is located above them, too. Busts are temporal. They will NOT persist through a scene change. This means if you go to a different map or enter a menu, the busts will disappear from the screen. That also means that saving while a bust is on the screen will not have them persist either as you would have to change scene to save. If you want to make something persist, I would recommend using pictures. Bust Defaults You can set where each bust is located on the screen and the settings that apply to them. You can make some smaller, some larger, some located on a higher Y position, and how they're anchored at the base. You don't have to adjust any of these settings since they'll work fine as they will scale to your game's resolution. Tweak them only if you want to. Bust Settings This is a section of mostly duration settings used by the various text codes made and used by this plugin. This is to let you set a default value if you ever decide to just cut the duration aspect out of the text codes to save time or to set up consistency. Auto Clear Other than the message bust, screen busts don't reset by themselves normally. You can turn this on by setting it to true and the busts will then disappear and automatically reset themselves each time after an event is over to save you the work of having to manually clear everything. Switching between pages in an Autorun event will also trigger Auto Clear. Even if this option is on, you will need to manually clear busts for busts that were made with parallel events or battle troop events. Don't worry, the code for that is simple if you just want to run a Script Call: Expression List Busts are capable of supporting multiple expressions. By default, busts will only have one expression: "Normal". To add more expressions to a single bust sheet, you will have to name your file a certain way. filename[BUST][Exp4x2].png Replace 4x2 with the number of cells going horizontal by vertical. 4x2 means there are 4 cells going horizontal and 2 cells going vertical. The cells can be used as expressions through the \bustExpression[id, expression] text code where 'expression' can be replaced by a number to represent the index (with zero as the starting index) or replaced by a keyword. Keywords can be inserted into the plugin parameter's Expression List, which automatically converts into an index. If "Angry" is the first string in the Expression List plugin parameter, using \bustExpression[0, Angry] will be the same as using \bustExpression[0, 1] as a text code. This means that the string entries correspond to their exact order in the Expression List plugin parameter so organize your bust cells to fit that usage. Let's take a look at an example bust: It's 2x2 cells. The filename format would be filename[BUST][Exp2x2].png. I hope that makes sense. Move Type This plugin supports move easings for busts. Move easings let a bust move in a non-linear fashion to make it look less stiff. You can still pick linear if you want, but this lets you set the default move type for each bust each time its settings are reset. Look deeper into the help section to what kind of easings there are. There's two different ways of controlling busts, 1) through the Show Text, event command and 2) script calls. Sane people will most likely be controlling the busts through the Show Text event, but for the people who want absolute control over the bust sprites, you can use the script calls. There's two places you can put your bust images: the img/faces/ or img/pictures/ folders. If you place them in img/faces/, you are able to change their bitmaps through both Show Text's text codes and Script Calls. If you place them in img/pictures/, then you can only change their bitmaps through Script Calls. Outside of changing the images, you can control them through both Show Text text codes and Script Calls. I just want to put this out there that bust text codes listed below are instant unless you modify them a certain way. That certain way is to add 'Msg' in between \bust and the keyword depicting the action. For example, becomes When you use 'Msg' in the text code, it will delay the instant nature of the text code to wait until the message window reaches that placement of where the 'Msg' version of the text code is. Let's take a look at this example: What will happen first is that the bust gets assigned to bust 0, the Message Window bust. The bust will slide in as per the instructions of the text code \bust[0]\bustSlideIn[0]. The text displayed will be 'Hello!' followed by a wait for input using the \! text code. The bust then changes to the angry expression through \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry] and displays the text 'Now I'm angry!' as the final action. That's the sequence of orders for the timings in the listed message. Does exactly what it means, display a bust. There are 11 busts that can be controlled. 0 is the Message Window's bust graphic. 1 through 10 are the busts that are shown on the screen behind the Message Window. Insert [BUST] into the filenames of face graphics and they will be setup automatically to change as the bust graphic. Harold.png will become Harold[BUST].png. This makes it unnecessary for you to use \bust[0] every time you want to set a bust to the message window itself. This only works for images in the img/faces/ folder. Clearing a bust removes it from view and resets it to the default settings so that the next time it's used, it will be a fresh slate. This is done automatically for message busts after the Message Window closes. A plugin parameter setting can be turned on to make all busts clear after an event finishes running. If you have set up a bust to use expressions, you can use this text code to change the expression of the bust. Please refer to the "Expression List" part of the help section up above to learn how to set up busts to make an expression sheet. You can play battle animations on the busts to depict actions, emotions, whatever you want them to do. These will play the battle animation only once before closing out. Play battle animations repeatedly instead of one time. Otherwise, this is the same as playing regular battle animations. Repeating animations will stop automatically for message busts when the window closes. For screen busts, they will vanish once the event terminates. Put an end to a repeating battle animation because otherwise that is going to go on forever until the currently running event fully terminates. Allows bust sprites to move to specific x and y coordinates. This does not work for message busts as they're locked to the Message Window. Allows bust sprites to move relative to their current position. This does not work for message busts as they're locked to the Message Window. Returns a bust sprite back to the home position. For those moments you're too confused, lazy, or both to figure out how to bring a bust sprite back to the original coordinates it was in. This does not work for message busts as they're locked to the Message Window. Allows you to adjust the rate, acceleration, and easing when a bust moves. Fade in to 255 opacity or fade out 0 opacity. This can affect any bust and you can also declare the duration of the fading process. If you don't want to fully change a bust's opacity to either 0 or 255, set it to whatever opacity level you want instead. This changes the opacity level of a bust relative to its current opacity instead of needing to put in an exact value. Sliding In and Sliding Out is a small move and fade in/out combo that is based around the bust's home position. This makes busts look like they're fading into the scene or fading out of them. Lets you set the bust sprite to mirror, unmirror, or toggle the mirror setting it currently has. This lets you change the scale of the bust sprite to an exact amount. Now, I know that sprites with a negative value for scale flip over, but these text codes and script calls will disable that. If you want to mirror something, use the mirror text codes for it. This lets you change the scale of the bust sprite relative to its current scale value. This will work with an absolute value of the current scale to remove any confusion about how mirrored scaling works, so just treat a bust that is mirrored the same way you'd treat a bust that's not mirrored. Give busts a tone! Tones will tint the colors on a bust. The bust will then change its tint towards that tone over time. Dim and Light are preset tones that are primarily used for tinting busts. Usually visual novels will dim busts that aren't talking and light the busts that are. This is to speed up the process so that you don't have to type out a tone code every time. You can set the dim and light values in the plugin parameters. They'll also use the duration for tones if no duration is used to specify that specific dim or light tone change. To have multiple busts do a bunch of things at once, you can use this piece of code in a script to accomplish it with whatever script call listed above. Replace the numbers in the array with the bust ID's that you want it to affect and whatever script calls in the middle after the $bust(i). Do not replace the i because that tells the code which bust to affect. Any number that's not listed in that array won't have the bust associated with it performing any of the listed actions in the middle. This plugin is made for and tested on RPG Maker MV with version 1.6.2. I cannot guarantee if it works on lower versions. 1. These plugins may be used in free or commercial games. 2. 'RPG Maker Irina' must be given credit in your games. 3. You are allowed to edit the code. 4. Do NOT change the filename, parameters, and information of the plugin. 5. You are NOT allowed to redistribute these Plugins. 6. You may NOT take code for your own released Plugins.

<TITLE>Poem</TITLE>
<TEXT>Small game about small struggles that feel big. Poem is about learning who you are through short dialogs and objects in your room. While trying to make your character be the most ready to face the challenge of going to school. The game has 2 endings witch I believe you'll find rather quickly. The game is rather short art project I made for school (SÅ UD Brno). When my teacher was giving me feedback they said: " Sometimes, we can only really speak through our creations, and let the players/readers feel for us what we cannot. ItÂ´s a perfect example of a symbiosis between the creator, and the created. " so I hope you will feel what I can not. Enjoy playing! <3 Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Ahh I love the design for this game! I really like the room escape-like layout (the furnishings and writings are so cute), and navigating the room with the avatar as a curser (haven't played much bitsy games, but it's the first time I came across something like this!) Got the "holding in" ending first, and the sudden colour change really scared me, but wow, it struck close to home. I could relate to the overwhelming feeling as presented, since I'm also the type of person to hide my negative feelings until they became too much. The display was so powerful, I could feel the hurt seeping through the screen. It makes getting the "letting yourself cry" ending so much more satisfying. Without the pressure to keep up a front, the day went surprisingly well, and it seemed like the mc found it better than usual! I couldn't 100% understand the ending bit, though, as it seemed to be written in Czech (did a rough translation via Google translate, so I get the gist of what it was trying to convey) I also enjoyed the tiny remarks from interacting with objects! Thank you for the poem, I quite enjoyed playing it! Thank you so much for your comment! It really means a lot for me. Sorry about one of the endings being in czech- it's a poem I wrote in my native language and I found it hard to translate without loosing it's rythm, so I hope you got at least the point across <3 Thanks again for playing and for sutch a nice comment, makes me want to invest more time into making games <3</TEXT>

W Game But Kinda Messed up for the dog dying & real Baby head breaking :( great game 10/10 I Have No Words... GG Bro... 10/10 Pretty good game really enjoyed it definitely looking forward to play more of your games Add interaction to make the car go HONK <3 pleeeeaaaaasssssssssssssssss Hi Monika.smidova! Great scary game. I was expecting something from that narrow door :O Thank you so much for the video I just wanted to say that I did the game in a team with my schoolmates- you can see that in the description ^^ my soul left my body when i looked upð­ I don't know how to get home in the game Hello! You can do that by pressing the door when you look up Ty Hectic! that jumpscare almost gave me a heart attack. Good game! I am using it for a yt vid eventually:) lame Included this in my 3 random horror game video! Short but not bad at all. Loved the whole premise of doing QC and then each day gets creepier and more morbid. Loved the whole idea. Made a video on it. I don't get scared really easily but the jump scare actually made me jump. the sounds were great. would def play a longer version The jump scare was funny. I love it hey ;p what the fuck <3 I liked the pixelated stock photo artstyle and the gameplay loop could be good if it was exapnded a bit, but the themes/story and actual horror fell pretty flat for me Ø§ÙØ¹Ø¨Ù Ø­ÙÙÙ I love the game but can anyone explain to me what its about? From what I understand, the player takes pills everyday, and it seems to make their hallucinations worse somewhat. WHAT'S IN THE BOX?? ð­ This game was fun to play on my channel! Art style is sick Vid: Wow, I loved the game so much the visual style, gameplay and the plot that I found it a bit murky at the end but I loved the game, I uploaded a video in Spanish ah YouTube, thanks ah the creators for recommending it to me Video link: I don't know why I thought playing this during school was a good idea. The random dude after the guy gasped made me jump out of my skin. 10/10. I got what I wanted. Nice game... I really liked this game. It's definitely a more crawls up slowly and gets more and more disturbing rather than a in your face sort of horror. It was also just the perfect length. It didn't drag on longer than it needed to, but it also wasn't too short. I also really LOVE the pixel art in this game. I really did enjoy playing this all the way through. Genuinely, for what it is, I give it a good 9.5/10. its k had an absolutely harrowing time. hated every moment. 10/10 great job Simple and dark... Great work here, Inbox team. I need more content just like this very soon. BRO THIS GAME HAS NO LOGIC AND WHY I EAT SOAP PILLS NOT SOAP like wtf is that mf on frugs too? how does one confuses soap with drugs? you made me kill a dog and baby They did offer you a free steak in between for the trouble though... yea but I didn't get to eat it I LOVED HOW CREEPY THIS WAS 8/10 KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!! the trigger warning disappeared to quickly for me to read, but otherwise, good game. its horrific, but is as written on the tin. I knew there was a jump scare when I heard that noise . . . don't do drugs kids *^* good game... you made me kill a dog so you lost 4 stars I'VE BEEN TRAUMATIZED! Really enjoyed this game, it's very dark and feels so gross and wrong lol Great work guys! </TEXT>

Yes, we're working on a fix, and it should be back on Steam soon ð Hey, stoked to see that the game is out of EA. I got the game through a bundle and noticed that there were instructions to actiavte it on Steam, but couldn't find a key anywhere. Where should I look? Is the latest version not available for download here? Got the game years ago in a bundle but only now got around to playing it. I loved it! I especially liked the story and the multinational cast of main characters. The artstyle is also very unique and pretty. Played through the entire game on steam deck and didn't encounter any technical issues. Thanks a lot for creating this! Amazing! Words can't express the beauty of this game. Great audio, visual arts and especially the story! If you're like me, and get emotionally tied to characters, you will love this. I loved the ending. Spent total of 15 hours, and I'm really happy that there are a lot of secrets for the map explorers. That was surely worth all the years of the development. At the beginning, I was ready to abandon this game, but when the story started to change I realized this is not a typical soldier simulator.. This game is a lot more than what is shown on the screenshots and whatsoever! Just finished the game. Great work! Looking forward to what you make next! Is there ever going to be a mac port? I played on my Macbook a couple years ago and want to play the full game now but I'm not able to :( Did the mac version of this game get taken down? I was playing this game and wanted to get back into it but I see now that it's become a windows only game and I'd really like to finish it but I don't have the hardware for a windows download :( Holaa! Soy yo o el juego ya no esta disponible para mac? ;-; justo me lo iba a instalar para jugar la version final T-T ni modo (rompeladompe) Hi! I bought this game as part of a bundle some years ago, and was going to finally try it out, but whenever I download the file for windows it says its damaged. I'm having the same problem for mac I've been checking some things and I think it's just that my internet right now is horrible. Hola! Muy buen juego! Resulta que reciÃ©n vi que la versiÃ³n final estÃ¡ disponible y querÃ­a saber si podÃ­a usar mis datos del early access para continuar con la versiÃ³n 1.03. De ser asÃ­, quÃ© archivos tengo que copiar? O tengo que comenzar de 0? nunca lo linkie a steam asiq no se actualizÃ³ solo :D ayura Tienes que jugar de nuevo, los saves no son compatibles entre versiones. Fuentes: I finally finished the game!! I've been playing and replaying this game since 2020. I am so proud of everyone for finally releasing the full thing! And man was it a blast. I can see so much improvement, especially with the menu UI. That was a treat to see. It didn't feel like I was over encumbered with random crap I'll never use unlike the previous builds. The thing that stuck out the most to me is I somehow missed the NPC that gives you the quartz watch, unless they were removed (or never existed in the first place and I'm misremembering). Which is a shame to me and me alone since that item was the first bonus equipment you got. I always treated it as my lucky item through my runs, so imagine my surprise when it came up as an item for finishing a battle! ALSO I didn't know that one quest needed low morale until this full playthrough so I must've been awful at keeping morale up lmao. Again amazing game, definitely would suggest to people who like compelling stories, awesome graphics, and fun turn based combat. I wouldn't call it challenging since I did not lose a single fight, only had 3 characters down through full playthrough, and had spare revive/healing items by the end of the final boss fight. But all of that could be because I replayed the game every time a new chapter was released so knew the strats/boss tactics. Anyhow, excited to see if this title ever gets sequels/prequels and what the team plans for games in the future!!! Hello! I'm replaying the game for the first time since release (super excited to revisit these characters :) ). Two questions: Is there a way to see morale? Additionally, are achievements Steam-only, or is there a menu for them in the game too? There's currently no way to see Morale. By design we considered it better to kept it hidden, but after lots of feedback from our players, we're considering how to implement it in a visual way. For now, achievements are only available on Steam, Xbox and Playstation. Hi, is there a way to quickly lower (and possibly re-raise) Morale? I'm in Kiel and there's a quest on Day 3 (Nighttime) that I found is only available with low Morale. I'd love to keep 100%ing every area, so if there was a cheat or something I could use to dump my Morale it'd be great :') It's intentional that there's no way to quickly change your Morale as it affects the characters personality, so it would look a bit inconsistent. After a lot of feedback from our players, though, we're thinking of making some changes to the Morale requirements so that people can 100% every area. Les quedÃ³ wenisimo, ojalÃ¡ haber comprado el juego aparte de un bundle, reciÃ©n vi que no puedo canjearlo en steam ajskdakj Â¡Felicidades por el Full Release! How can i migrate my save data from the old version to 1.0.0? My old save is in âAppData/LocalLow/BURAâ but the new version saves to âAppData/LocalLow/This I Dreamtâ. Are the saves compatibles at all or iâll have to replay the game? Edit: Someone asked the same on the steam forum Unfortunately, old saves no longer work because several internal changes were made, and the game would crash. Gracias Camila por tu respuesta. No es lo que querÃ­a pero se entiende completamente. Al menos ahora puedo ver todo lo que cambiÃ³ entre el EA y el final :D Hello there.I just wanted to say thank you for lowering the price for the switch.-release right on the release day, making it 5â¬ cheaper. Nice move. I actually pre-ordered the game full-price some days ago and feel a little bit cheated now. As I said: Nice ass move. It really makes me not to want to buy your next game. :( Congratulations on your full release! Really excited to play it now :) Is there an option to link it to my steamaccount so I can update the game via Steam? Cheers! Thank you so much! If you bought the game on itch, you'll find an option to redeem your Steam key. If you got the game through a bundle, it doesn't come with a Steam key, though (this is done to prevent people from reselling the games from these massive bundles, sorry about that!) Congrats on your release! Does it work for the newest macOS system? I've tried opening it and I get a message saying it's damaged and can't opened. I can run the early access version just fine tho. I have an older macOS system and sadly it's the exact same case for me. oof Hi there! We just uploaded a new Mac version that should fix that issue! Thank you so much for reporting this! We're looking for a fix right now, we'll try to have it as soon as possible! Thank you for responding so quickly! However the new file still does not work. Is there a specific place I can report bug reports? Oh no, I'm sorry to read that! We'll continue looking for a fix. This is our bug report form: https://forms.gle/RCfQA4JRTCtHkUN7A Hi there! We just uploaded a new Mac version that should fix that issue! I am so exited that we have a release date! I loved playing this game. Hello, How do I update the game if I already own it? This game looks awesome! I really love the art style! militarily is not a theme I usually like to explore in games but I absolutely want to play this game! Wine still canât run it on Linux :/ Iâm using the Lutris fshack 7.2 runner and has been working well since the last verion and 1.0 too I have the game on here but im now on linux steamdeck. how can i play this? Hey! A few weeks late, but I can help. Lutris on Steam Deck now has Itch compatibility, so you can install and play the game that way. You may need to manually select the exe though. I've been playing it that way. I noticed that Adair has Poland flag! :) Wow, I didn't expected that. Greetings from Poland. Really loved everything about this game! Fantastic game - especially loved the audio design and animations both in and out of battle. Appreciate how the game integrates different languages and the need for interpreters. Thanks for all the great work, can't wait to play the final chapter! Considering the burnout issues you had a while ago I won't ask when you think the game will be done. However, if possible, I would like to know 2 things. Is the game still in active development? And which parts of the game are finished, and which are still to be worked on? This game is absolutely fantastic, I've loved everything about it so far! I'm extremely excited to see how the plot will continue forward from here. Just a few items of feedback, the game feels like it could use some quality of life adjustments. Showing your party's active buffs, being able to compare weapons when equipping, displaying % chances for random effects are some I noticed in terms of combat. Improved settings would also be greatly appreciated; a way to toggle sprinting is really needed because my fingers hurt from holding shift so long lol. A way to adjust dialogue speed and controls for ease of use would also be great. These are just a few of the aspects which I feel need a little bit more polish, but these are also relatively easy to overlook considering how enchanting and real the story feels. My heart really goes out to the developers for this amazing and unique work. Is the game still in early access? I was incredibly surprised by the writing here, and the pixel assets are fine and do the job of giving you an environment to traverse but the hand-drawn art assets are top knotch. They're used infrequently but when they come up they really set the tone. Got this in the bundle for Ukraine and instead of getting bad writing I got an interesting story with somewhat clunky combat about someone wrapped up in a conspiracy thriller that takes them all across Europe running into difficulties with language barriers and different cultural customs while political drama unfolds all around you, and you're trying to piece it together. The combat feels awkward, but its entirely forgivable since you spend so little time interacting with it. The game is simply not about that part, and it serves as a decent break from all the other stuff you generally get up too during the game. Recommend, but don't expect it to be a hype train of constant action. If you want an interesting story and great artwork this is for you. Thanks for putting this in the bundle because otherwise I'd have never heard of it. Now to figure out when the next release is so I can keep playing it. A must-have for the players who enjoy military topics and anime-style visual novels. Long Gone Days has very high-quality work on its cutscenes, character animation, combat system, and pixel art. And most important: the story is very catchy. Thank you so much, we're glad you enjoyed it! I managed to download this game and play it, it was honestly amazing, however I haven't been able to find the steam key to add it to my Steam library, is there any way you could help? Hi there and thank you for your kind words! If you got the game through a bundle (Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality, Bundle for Palestinian Aid, Bundle for Ukraine) it won't come with a Steam key. If you bought the game separately, there should be a "Claim Key" button right next to the Download button. Aaah, that explains it, yeah I got it through a Bundle. I'll pay the game fully when its out of EA then, very impressed by this! Oh, just in case, you'll get access to all the updates anyway if you got it through a bundle, so don't feel pressured to buy it again! ever since i first played this game over a year ago, it's been stuck in my head. it's just so good -- the plot, the writing, the characters, the art. everything just comes together extremely effectively within the narrative. i found myself completely immersed in these characters and their lives and just ahh!! i genuinely have no words for how much i love this game and how excited i am to play it in full! This is such a good game, i really enjoyed playing it. The characters are really nice and fleshed out, as is the story. The combat system is simple but amazing. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes rpgs, its amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I'm glad you enjoyed it! I ain't played an RPG for years, but a friend said to try this - and so glad he did, I really enjoyed it !! Aww, I'm really glad to hear that â¥!</TEXT>

<TITLE>World Long Gone (2020)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Hello, thank you for your interest in the game ! Here are some things you should know before downloading. 1- This game is a game designer student project made with a team of 4 people. It was almost entirely made with the "PlayMaker" plugin which allowed us to do visual scripting. It does contains some C# scripts that interacts with key gameplay features, as we faced some of the Playmaker's limitations. We are proud and thankful for that, since it boosted our programming skills from zero to...well something ! 2 - The game was made in about 3 months. 3 - You will be able to experience the idea of the game, understand its vision, but a lot of features are still missing ! You should read the "how to play section" in the main menu, as it displays a lot of useful informations (that would otherwise be distilled in the first playthrough.) We'd really like your inputs and feedbacks on this prototype. Feel free to comment and share your experience ! Was the purpose of the game clear to you ? Did you try things that were not possible ? If so, what led you to believe it was ? What would you add to the game to make it better ? Did you like the game ? We look forward to read your comments ! How to play : 1 - Download the .zip archive and extract it in a local folder 2 - Run the .exe within the extracted folder. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>A Light Long Gone$4.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable interactive album for Windows and Linux Welcome to the digital album release of "A Light Long Gone", which allows you to listen to individual instruments in any combination you want and explore my music in a more intimate way. You can watch the complete instrumental mix on YouTube , which is a recording of the running application that you can interact with. All of the original songs (which include vocals for the most part) are available for free on YouTube , in addition to Spotify and various other digital music markets. In 2019, I decided to create one song per month. While mostly electronic, it contains instruments such as grand piano, acoustic guitar, vocals, with several additions by guest musicians (cello, violin, trumpet, e-bass, and many more). Most songs can probably be categorized as chill/downtempo, and revolve around dark/depressing themes, with a few rays of hope every now and then. Thank you for listening to my music. <a href=" Faith" class="redactor-linkify-object"> https://muddasheep.itch.io/faith-in-despair">Faith in Despair by muddasheep</a> In order to download this interactive album you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $4.99 USD.

Wow, so glad I found this hidden gem in the bundle, and thanks for supporting Ukraine with your work! Is there somewhere I can send you what I would have paid if I hadn't bought it with the bundle? Like a KoFi page or Patreon?? Thank you so much! I'm glad people are discovering it and that my work can be part of something that is used for good. Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/muddasheep Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/muddasheep I was looking around in the bundle for racial justice again some time after I bought it and I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised to have found this album in the middle. Amazing music! And messing around with the songs, enabling/disabling instruments and the voice, is a pretty nice touch. Thank you very much for this :3 Thank you for playing it and for your kind words!! Can't get this to load on my mac running Catalina. Vague error message says "The application âALightLongGone_MACâ canât be opened." Hey denvergreene! I cannot test this myself, but this is what I found: https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/dpyo0o/building_unity_project_for_mac_osx_1015_catalina/f7dhhgy/ Quote: "The solution is to chmod +x App/Contents/MacOS/* from the terminal as the application did not have the executable flag set. After this guardian catches it and control clicking on the app lets it be opened." Please let me know if that fixes the issue! Absolutely groundbreaking. I listened to your album three times in a row and, with toggling instruments on and off, it felt like listening to three different albums. It is not an overstatement to say that the way I interacted with your work has changed the way I see music, which I have loved for all my life but can hardly understand from a technical standpoint. It has brought me closer to it like few things have. Thank you so much :) Wow, thank you so much for your kind words!! That makes me really happy ð¸ I really loved the album! Thank you so much for making it <3 Thank you for listening to it! <3 Hi there! First off thank you for be apart of the bundle! Secondly I can't seem to get it to work on my PC and I dont know what i'm doing wrong T-T Hello durzarina! Thanks for supporting the bundle and for downloading my album! Are you getting any errors? I assume you downloaded the Windows ZIP file and started the exe file, is that correct? Yes that's correct. It comes up but then immediately closes itself without error or anything. I even tried opening it as administrator. Still nothing â¹ï¸ Oh no ): That sounds bad, I'm not sure how I can reproduce and fix this. Which operating system are you running, is it Windows 10? You can also contact me at muddasheep@gmail.com if you want to keep the discussion going there. Edit: Here's a thread on reddit with a few ideas/potential solutions, even though I realize you said you don't get an error message. It is a Unity application, so that may be able to help you. Let me know if you can figure it out! Thank you for including this in the bundle :) Thank *you* for supporting it and for your comment! Great album. Great visualization!

Without notice, reports have been received by Radcairnâs Lord Mayor that bands of bugbears and goblins have been spotted along the High Road to the north. Your task is to find out why! â¢ Are they scavenging the old mines for iron and tools? â¢ Are they were highwaymen attempting to make quick coin bowling over traveling parties? â¢ Are they scouting new locations for a hideout and keep? Or is something altogether more sinister at play… A minimal setting and minor dungeon designed for easy drop-in play with Old-School Essentials.

<TITLE>Nature's Ballroom</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack for Windows A lot of the influence for this scene comes from Naughty dogâs The Last of Us and Lucky Pauseâs Homesick titles respectively. Furthermore, outside of video games areas such as Chernobyl were influential in that they convey a sense of nature reclaiming what belongs to it. The overall theme of the project was to project a sense of abandonment and yet rebirth by nature. This was something that particularly served the colour palette of the final piece as many of the civilised world assets contained desaturated values. Whereas on the other hand the nature and botanical aspects were much more saturated creating contrast in the piece. To this point the stark contrast and dilapidated objects in the scene tell the story and give the environment character that the influential material conveys itself to a viewer. This theme and setting was ultimately chosen to diversify a current portfolio of work. The current pieces are heavily contrasting and use lots of orange tones. Thus the inclusion of a piece using a varied colour palette was something that drove the project. As a centrepiece to the project a Grand Piano was chosen to reflect the retaking of the land by nature. The Grand Piano is an object that is seen as expertly crafted and beautiful and thus beating it up and seeing it run down is something that is easily observed. Furthermore, the inclusion of Georgian architecture seemed to fit the grandiose nature of the setting. Whilst features such as large lattice doors and sash windows are included mainly for the aspect of lighting. Below are a few images that visually display the aforementioned theme. A little over 3 weeks well (and stressfully!) spent. Learnt a lot about motivating myself and getting a scene done in a third of the time I usually do. Some Really good pieces being submitted good luck to all the other artists! No sketchfab Links (Marmoset Viewer Files have been attached below!)</TEXT>

<TITLE>One Last Journey</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game One Last Journey is a hand-drawn, 2.5D narrative adventure where players step into the shoes of Cain, an immortal adrift in a world carved from sorrow and fading memories—a world haunted by the echo of a long-lost love. As they turn each page, the line between fiction and reality begins to blur. And as Cain descends deeper into his journey of guilt and redemption, the mother is quietly forced to confront the regrets sheâs kept buried—while her son begins to understand the fragile, enduring nature of love and loss. Switch between two layers of narrative: play as Cain inside the fairy tale, while hearing real-time voiceover conversations between the mother and child reacting to the events. A unique blend of creepy and cute aesthetics, all lovingly drawn by hand to evoke a sense of fragile beauty and melancholy. Solve environmental puzzles, interact with memory-laden objects, and face bosses that represent guilt, denial, and grief. Unlock a hidden chapter where the story turns inward—not to the hero on the page, but to the hands that held the pen. Discover the final message of the fablemaker himself. Let music guide your way. With lullaby-based sequences inspired by the musical comic Sihir Rindu , each note is a memory, and every silence means something.

I waiting forward for the update!!!! been waiting for months.... I re-download it once I get new device recently. fall in love with the colour. it feels like laying down on cloud. a lullaby for eyes. keep it up please!!! waiting forward!!!!!!!!! mac version when please? Please wait! We're working hard to finish the game first before creating the mac version. Thank you very much! :D I'm absolutely smitten with the adorable art style of this game! As a first-time player, I completely fell in love with the concept and core gameplay. The way the story is delivered through bedtime stories and the clever puzzles make it an incredibly engaging experience. The character and enemy designs are gorgeous, and the mechanics are truly fascinating. The demo did a fantastic job showcasing them, and I'm eagerly anticipating more puzzles that utilize these mechanics in the future. All in all, I'm head over heels for this game and can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the amazing work, Masbro! By the way, if you ever release collectibles or merchandise for this game, I'd definitely be interested in collecting them. Just saying! Thank you for your comment! Of course we will make any collectibles for the players to buy and collect them, please stay tuned for updates! Very nice experience. Overall I will give it a 7 to 7.5 out of 10. Let's talk about the good stuff first. This game is being carried HARD by its storytelling. Not just the story - I would say the story itself is just good at best - but the atmosphere and the delivery are just awesome. Major factors on why it is awesome: Crispy voice acting, beautiful background musics, and cool CGs (yep, you can tell I'm a sucker for visual novels). The story text itself could make use of some refinement here and there, but I'd say it's still nice. Now let's talk about the stuff that needs to be taken care of: the gameplay . To be fair, the game itself is obviously far from polished, hence the janky gameplay. But, to me at least, the gameplay did no justice to the fantastic storytelling. Bugs here and there, monster AI not working as intended (based on my expectation as a player, that is), weird checkpoint/spawn location, lacking features (such as running), and...... Well generally, more work needs to be done to make the gameplay proper. I'm hoping to see more of Cain's story in the future. Thank you for your comment! Yeah we are still working on the gameplay, please stay tuned for future updates! Heyooo Aku suka banget game nya! art nya bagus banget banyak aku screenshot buat wallpaper! hahaha. untuk dari aku ad feedback nih! apakah mungkin bisa dibuat lari? lalu indicator digest nya mungkin bisa dibuat lebih menonjol agar player aware kali ya? misalnya shaking atau warna nya kedip2 begitu. tadi aku juga smpat kena bug saat loncat dengan srigala hahaha, dan si monster gendut gabisa aku pakai dorong dari belakang ya? hanya dari depan.. tapi over all bagus banget! bakal happy kali ada Artbook nya nih ;) semangat terus ya! Hai Halo, Hana! Ur words warms our heart â¥ï¸ Feedback-feedback kamu udah kami catat dan akan dipertimbangkan! Wish you have a nice dream, always! This game is very pretty! I really like the art style and the designs for the characters and enemies. The mechanic too was really interesting! The demo really showcases the mechanics quite well and would love to see more puzzles utilising the mechanic more in the future! Hai! weâre glad that you love it! Thank you for showing One Last Journey to the world via your youtube! Saw sochiiru's post about the game and decided to come check it out! I lovee the art style its so cute. Hey there! Thank you for trying our demo. Glad you love it. May I know who is this beloved Sochiiru? Big journey. Thank you for playing our game! Thank you for trying One Last Journey and the feedback! We will improve the demo, stay tuned! As 1st demo, i'd say that i fell in love with the concept and core gameplay. Especially how it deliver the story as bed time stories.

<TITLE>Menagerie of the Void$5</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Menagerie of the Void is a storytelling game for one player. You play as the keeper of an ancient menagerie, created by a long-gone society and still operating. You create the story as you play, writing down some details, deciding how to care for the exhibits, and drawing cards to see what happens next. It takes an hour or two to play, using this booklet (28 pages), a bunch of index cards, and a deck of regular playing cards. Physical version is available through Indie Press Revolution , and perhaps your local game store as well. Note: This game could potentially feature bodily trauma, harm to animals, and some degree of mind control. -- You are the pilot of humanity's 2nd faster-than-light ship, reaching into interstellar space, ready to explore the great, dark unknown. But something has malfunctioned. The stars are wrong. Through the window you see an old dusty planet, from which a beam of light emerges to engulf your ship as an alien presence integrates with your systems. Your gut lurches as you lose and regain consciousness—now you stand in a hall of groaning, rusty engines, the dried corpse of an alien creature before you. You feel a burst of pain as a metallic arm retreats from your head, leaving behind a cybernetic module in your brain. Through it, these old automated systems speak to you: âA new zookeeper has been acquired.â This is the story of how you were compelled to try and eventually failed, as many have before you. -- Inspirational background soundtrack -- Menagerie of the Void is licensed under CC BY 4.0. Do what you want with it, just please tell me about it! Main inspirations are the episode â Stewtopia â of Voyage to the Stars, Star Control 2 and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space. If you are familiar with some indie games, this plays on similar vibes to those of The Wretched or Mothership , but you manage a sad zoo. -- "Is the fun of playing games only in the winning? Or is it delighting in the myriad ways in which we can fail? Menagerie of the Void certainly succeeds in the latter." - supercircuit (full review here ) "This is a mechanically very interesting and tonally quite melancholy game that I enjoyed very much. Sometimes, doing a certain thing is valuable in its own even if it proves to be fruitless in the long run. The events unfolding are so different that no one playthrough feels the same. The cycle concept also make me imagine all the subsequent characters will find a mark left behind by the last one - they're all connected in this desperate endavour to keep the menagerie thriving against the odds. Beautiful and haunting." - Myfawnwy In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $5 USD.

Any chance of scoring a physical copy of this anymore? ð¤© Yas! https://leisuregames.com/products/menagerie-of-the-void This game is wonderful. I nurtured and lost wondrous beings, and finally gave into the despair and let go of control. My soundtrack was Clint Mansell film scores. My journal was several pages and I drew all the incoming exhibits/creatures. What an unique 2 hour trip into the void. Hi, i played my 1st game last weekend and it was very cool! My PC recovered his freedom and the best is to come with the next zoo keeper ^^ Fanx !! (sorry for my bad english 0_0, i am french ^^)</TEXT>

Notes here: https://leicestersramble.blogspot.com/2025/06/mini-review-tragic-curse-of-grimhi... Thanks a lot for the recap:) The possibility of TPK is always there, even for larger groups. Good that you tweaked some encounters. Glad you put the lovers to rest. They deserved it :) I grabbed this a while ago (for free; really wasn't sure I'd ever even read it). Recently decided to take a look and try it out (ran it online via Owlbear.rodeo + discord over several sessions). Just came back to give it a thumbs up - and to pay more than the asking price. Well worth it. Thanks, that was great. It's not especially Shadowdark-ish to my mind -- it would work well with essentially any OSR game or might even adapt pretty well to a 5e game with a few tweaks. Would consider running it again (in Shadowdark or otherwise) with a different group, but I might tweak it a bit more than I did this time. Thank you very much :) Glad you and your group enjoyed the adventure. Excellent adventure here! The framing makes it perfect to fit in the middle of any adventure, and the design makes it easy to understand. Thank you very much! Glad you liked it. :) This is awesome, It is really well organize, and it is very grim dark Thanks a lot :) Very nice. Thank you! Thank you very much! Wow. Really awesome! Thanks GobyGames :) another great release, I love the writing and the artstyle! Thanks, Felspherus! Glad you enjoyed the adventure. Much appreciated. Super content Thanks a ton!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Hiraeth - A story of valor</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows âHiraethâ is a 3D action adventure game set in a science fantasy world, where technology merges with nature. There, the young hero Key takes a stand against his enemies and starts his adventure to purify the lands of Astos - colourful forests, energy crystals pulsing with power and long lost ruins, where myths slumber. Driven by his wish to banish the evil plaguing his world, Key sets out to bring back a long-gone legend. To do that he must combat his foes and show bravery in the most dire situations, never giving up the hope for a brighter future. Only then will the guardian see his pure soul and accept him as his pilot. Explore the world of Hiraeth either as Key, the boy with a soul filled with hope and bravery, or pilot his legendary companion, the guardian of ancient times. And as fit for a legend, the guardian is capable of summoning the great power to defeat evil. The game was made as a student project at games academy berlin with a team consisting of nine people. Team Production: Jelena Potthoff - Producer - LinkedIn Game Design: Ashkan Naserian - Game Design - LinkedIn Aline Drobek - Level Design, 2D Art - LinkedIn Nikolas Kerner - Game Design - LinkedIn Art: Rafael-Luis Coskun - Concept/Charakter/UI Artist- LinkedIn Filip Enache - FVX Artist - LinkedIn Kevin Franke - Hard Surface Artist - LinkedIn Sophie Capers - Environment Artist - LinkedIn Tarik Yumak - Environment Artist - LinkedIn Marco Rudijc - Animation Artist - LinkedIn Programming: Keanu Carlo - Programmer - LinkedIn Mert Yonkuc - AI Programmer - LinkedIn Music: Jens J.

Overall, the art direction is nice, but I think it's pretty clear this was developed by some students as there were a lot of bugs or poor design choices. One of the very first things I noticed was the lack of keyboard prompts for the game. The controller prompts remained on screen at all times but didn't inform the player of what the keyboard controls are. Due to a lacking options menu that would allow me to invert the X-axis on the right control stick (I know I'm weird, but it's just how I am comfortable playing games) this lead to the awkward decision of having to either rough-it with a control scheme I didn't know, or rough-it with a control format that is difficult for me to control. For a student project, I wouldn't expect an extensive options menu, however, I do feel like teaching the student how to detect what input is being used and changing the on-screen prompts would not only be a good lesson for the students, but also make the game more accessible. The combat was also frustrating to deal with. This mostly came down to the slow pace of the combat, the lack of a targeting system causing the player character to eventually finish their combo no where near the neighborhood of the enemy, and enemies still being able to attack the player even after they are dead. What made this worse is that clearly the game is checking whether the player has killed a certain number of enemies or not in order to progress to the next area, but due to the save system being borked, I wound up skipping a lot of combat which later seemed to break the game as the gate to the next area wouldn't open. I assume somewhere in some empty field 1 enemy remained, but with the really short stamina bar for sprinting, I just couldn't be bothered to search for him.

Having made a secret deal with enemy forces it is now your mission to lose the war! Prevent your units from controlling the central point. Controls: W - Move camera up S - Move camera down A - Select left card D - Select Right Card Click - Build a wall (if a tile is valid, ie not right in front of spawns and not on the point), requires 8 money. Walls despawn after about 60 seconds. Your pieces move autonomously , but you do have some say in which troop to send forth. Select one of the two troops presented to you every opportunity. With money earned from defeating opponents, you can build walls to "create cover" for your troops.. or lead them to doom! Piece types: Pawns: The weakest unit, but can break through placed walls. Bishop: Good at maneuvering around walls and has medium stats. Rooks: The strongest unit, but moves slowly and has trouble traversing complicated terrain. Unfortunately I was unable to get sound in on time, and some game variables are balanced poorly. Art is mine except for the walls/gate sprite, as well as the UI sprite.

You will get access to the following files: View all posts Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. the fullscreen doesnt work awesome game Is this game on Steam no its free to download on this web page that youre currently looking at very interesting... Finally got around to playing this after picking up the bundle last year; extremely cool shit. Feels smooth as silk, and there's a dreamy tenor to the whole thing that feels effortless. Great game. I'm a huge fan of this game, I've fully completed it many times, and I've been speedrunning it for a while, but one thing I can't figure out is whether or not there's supposed to be something hidden in this room. There are the red skull blockers that are supposed to indicate a fight, but no matter what I've tried, I've never seen them turn on... Love the game and the music, playing on an old Mac using https://www.winehq.org/ and it runs fine.. Hey, I've made a video about your game and I wanted to give you some feedback that hopefuly ends up being useful for you if you plan on continue developing the game or making new ones :D -Making a tutorial that shows you all the movements that your character can do could be awesome. I discovered some movements by "error" trying some things to continue on the game. -From what I've played the game is very polished and I didn't find any reaaaally big bug/glitch on it :D In general the game is quite awesome :), hopefuly this helped you. Regards doesn't seem to play nice with wine on linux, very jittery and sluggish =[ I'm generally a fan of these type of game, though I am not the most proficient gamer, but I kinda got pretty stuck on this one. I think if I pushed hard enough I'll figure it out or perhaps I am just stupid and ultimately quit due to being stuck. Other than that, this is a beautiful looking game with some interesting gaming mechanics. I'll pick this back up again in the near future. Hollow Knight and Dead Cells run on my computer with no issues. For some bizarre reason, this game's performance is absolutely DREADFUL. I don't know what the dev could have possibly done to make it run so poorly. No exaggeration, I get about 5 FPS, and the game itself runs in slow-motion, at like 1/6th of the normal speed. Hilariously, the frame skip feature has absolutely no impact on the performance or speed of the game, it just halves the framerate, making the game even more unplayable. I was quite hyped for the game, and I would still love to come back and play it, if and when this all gets fixed. I had a similar problem, but only in the "undead town" area of the game. The game up until then had run fine. It was only using 5% of my CPU during the slowdown as well, which makes me think maybe it's a weird timing issue rather than a performance problem. I'm late to the party, but wanted to say that this game is absolutely fantastic. It took a bit to get a handle on the controls, but from then on it was really enjoyable. Art and sound design meant both exploration and combat felt super satisfying. this looks very interesting! is there any chance of a linux port? Yeah, I want to like this game 'cus the atmosphere, but... it just feels too busted. Even with a controller. The timing on the jump mechanics are WAY too unforgiving for how often you have to use them (the super jump is a pain in the butt to pull off), leads to stuff like rolling into an open door and resetting the room, etc. Combine that with my weapons breaking and no way to change my input layout from the janky default and I just like... stopped playing. Potential to be fun, though. Played this for a video as part of my channel's Christmas special, and through the first boss, I am really liking this game. The surreal and ominous atmosphere is wonderful, in both the sound and visual design. The controls can be a little difficult, but that's probably more my weak skills than a failing of the game. And the enemy designs... well the giant living gravestone with a gold tooth is wonderfully absurd, I can't wait to see the rest! Video is here, if you're curious: With what game engine did you make this in? Great game btw. Thank You for making this <3 I can't believe this is free. It's so good. Any chance for a Mac build? I would also love to play this game. A Mac build would be great. I keep rewatching the trailer - love the sound design. i've been playing your game for a long time, and i can say that i really love playing it. but for now, i got stuck under a bridge, is there a way to break it from underneath? (i broke it by accident, that's how i got in) owch, you made those very well hidden! i'm feeling kinda dumb actually. thankfully, i'm out - now i can enjoy the game more. thanks! Got this game for free a while back, loved it so much I came back and donated $10. I love the abstractness and the fluidity of the controls/movement. Thank you for making a solid indie title Hey Jesse. I didn't know how to contact you in any other way so I'll post here. I need to know what engine you used to make Water's Fine! The game inspired me beyond anything else and I must find out what you used as it's so compact, neat and quick to run this... game... is... AWESOME! Dear Owch, me and my son are really enjoying your game (though we are currently only on the demo). However we have gotten stuck in a room: Please can you tell me how we can get the key? We think it must be to do with lighting (or un-lighting) all the lights. But we've tried both and that didn't help. We've also kill both bats but that didn't seem to trigger anything. The sword on the right can be thrown into a wall, but doesn't give access to the key? Also if we leave this room there is no way to back-track. Please help! I've only played the demo so far, but the atmosphere and mechanics are superb. Ok, didn't understand how to make the super jump ^_^' I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but I literally can't super jump even once. I've been trying for 5 minutes straight (I seem to be stuck near the start because of this) but no dice.. I'm pretty sure I understand the concept (jump when landing from a roll-jump) but I just can't get it to happen. I've tried pressing it early, I've tried pressing it late; I've tried spamming the jump button, it's just not happening! :/ Is there any chance this is some weird input bug? I'm on win7. This game looks so amazing, I'd really love to play it but this seems impossible for some reason. ;-; lol.. okay after posting I tried again for a while, this time spamming all buttons chaotically, and something happened! This allowed me to try some experiments and I've figured out what's happening (sort of): just pressing X doesn't do it. Instead, when I land I seem to have to press *backwards* (run direction) and X. This is the only way to trigger the super jump as far as I've found, simply holding down doesn't work. Okay I'm an idiot: my problem was that I was holding the down key the whole time. I guess this should be obvious, but anyway if I let go of down when I hit X on landing, it works.. hooray! Sorry about that -- I'm going to leave this thread instead of deleting it in case it helps anyone else that's dumb like me ;) I need to try this—thanks! Have been having the same issue with the super jump ð¤¯ awesome animations and colors, cool! The fly function if i attack and jump is very buggy i glitched somewhere outside the screen. But also very nice game i like the game design. CAN'T BE 'CLAIMED' this is such a nice game i loved it so much. everything from the music to the art was absolutely amazing and the pacing was really nice. i loved all the various areas and the characters with their dialogue were so adorable i especially loved the combat system with the items breaking and having to grab stuff enemies threw! my fav weapon was the fish that shoots bubbles, was it intentional that it did not break? anyway after all my other weapons broke i just slapped through rest of the game with the fish! ^^ all the bosses were so fun, especially the last boss, which definitely was challenging with so much going on at once. i tried to start a new game with a harder difficulty but the game just kept crashing for some reason, do you have any idea what could be causing it? I FINALLY got around to beating this game today! I have to say; I LOVED every single moment. This game is nothing short of amazing and I'm honestly extremely sad that more people don't know about it. I look forward to anything you make in the future! Awesome game with great music! I had a lot of fun making this episode. This game looks very interesting It's a shame that only runs on Windows Everyone keeps calling me <ERROR> and referring to locations as <ERROR>. Is this an actual error or a nod to Zelda 2 or something? At first I thought it was a joke but now everyone is calling me <ERROR> When you change your key bindings, the tutorial isn't updated to reflect that, which makes it terribly confusing to follow. I cannot do the super jump in the tutorial. I assume I'm supposed to hit X right when I hit the ground after jumping ? ? I'm stuck in the damn tutorial. Thanks man, I tried something like that but I didn't figure out the timing. I've got it now. Your game is fun so far. :L How do I play this new DEMO? Can't figure out the super jump, it only happens accidentally. Also, I wish I could redefine the \, ], and [ keys. All I do on the demo is go to the right, try to roll under the snow bank, I don't make it and die. The demo version before this update didn't do this, I at least got to another room at the far right. Is this new DEMO working correctly? I really want to buy the game but need to have these issues explained first, I don't want to buy it and have all these apparent glitches still there. I love how the game looks and feels though!!! Awesome! I assume the full version is okay, correct? Really love the game man, great job! I also love ADVENTURES. However, it says OPEN ALPHA DUNGEON and DEMO DUNGEON. Are you planing on making a full version of ADVENTURES? It's hard as Hell but I keep going back for more punishment, each time getting a bit further. 8) P.S. - Just played the new DEMO you fixed, it's working great and I got farther than ever before! What a cool game!!! I'm going to buy the full game RIGHT NOW! 8) P.S. II - Just bought the full game. Plan on playing it tonight. 8) BTW - I use WINE under Linux to play. It works great but have you ever considered doing a Linux build? I just beat the game and I'll admit, I'm a little confused by the ending. I get that it's an apocalypse but I had trouble understanding what was going on and why I even fighting all those people or why other NPCs seemed to act like I had a history with them. Overall it was fun but I really wish I knew what happened.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Long Live The Queen$10</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Being a Princess is not an easy job. Being a Queen is even harder. Especially when you're only fourteen years old, and the reason you've inherited the throne is that your royal mother has just met an untimely end. Now power is up for grabs. You may be the official heir, but much of the country's nobility would love to steal the throne for themselves. Aggressive neighbors will take advantage of any weakness to enlarge their borders at your expense. And that's not even mentioning the magical dangers which are lying in wait... Can you survive long enough to reach your coronation? Guide Elodie on her road to coronation by choosing her skills and activities, and decide how to handle the different crises that spring up along the way. Beware - every character has an agenda, and seemingly innocuous choices might lead to certain doom! Train in dozens of different skills, manage your moods, juggle your alliances, and decide how ruthless you want to be. Each challenge that Elodie faces can be successfully conquered by multiple different methods, but there are always more ways to lose than to win.

<TITLE>Long Count$2.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Then seek no further my friend, this game is made for you. But be aware, I can guarantee you, this will be as frustratingly hard as in the old days !!! Embark on a journey to unravel a long lost mystery, explore the old town of the beautiful city of Heidelberg, Germany in this interactive novel. In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $2.99 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. hi again.. very pleased as completed day 1&2 with ur vague hints.. Iâm totally stuck on day 3.. got the pendant havenât a clue what to do.. also been to the university got the envelope interacted with the phone & went to the police station.. went back to the university got another envelope which keeps happening & my phone returns at the book shop.. Iâve worked out I need the robe from the priest but I donât no how either.. please can u help x Hi, the multiple envelopes is actually a bug. If you combined phone and envelope and got another envelope from the unversity afterwards, you should uncombine phone & envelope first (just click on the item in the inventory and then select the option) and not get another envelope from the university once you combined them again because this state could break things going further. You should either have one envelope and one phone seperate or 1 item with them combined, not the combined item and an additional envelope or phone in your inventory. Regarding the university puzzle, it's all about getting into the office of Polizeikommisar Glocke, there's an item under the bridge that helps with the priest (also check out the hint from steam) and you also should take a look at the phone settings, maybe this will give you a push in the right direction on how to solve it. Best regards Christian I am totally stuck on the coordinates Iâve made the holes in the letter but canât work it out Hi, if you are still on day 1 you should postpone solving the letter puzzle until you reach day 2 and instead thoroughly inspect the desk in the bookstore. If you are already on day 2, you can check out these hints I posted on steam: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1190270/discussions/0/2270321250036863651/ Best regards Christian thank you hello! Loving the game. But Iâm stuck. I need to get into the police station to use the phone book but the police think Iâm a murderer. Iâve used glove with robe, guessing I need to make a disguise but I canât work it out! Help! Thereâs another phone book at the airport. Best regards ah I feel like an idiot :) Thanks! Looking forward to part 2. Any update on when that might be? Sorry, I can't give you a release date for part 2, my games are always ready when they are ready. ð Best regards Christian Iâm absolutely loving this game, however Iâm pretty stuck and would be so grateful for any help regarding the coordinates, the quote is really stressing me out, Having read the 2 hints given to previous poster, Iâm okay with the inventory combo point but stuck completely on the quote, I would be unbelievably grateful for a hint, do I need to be in a certain location with the letter for example? Thank you to any Good Samaritan out there in these crazy lockdown times, this game is my lifeline right now :-) Hi there, thanks for playing my game, I'm glad you like it. Regarding the quote, I hid another hint for this puzzle in the game, which gets revealed when you use the magnifier on the quote. But as always it's a very vague hint, hope this helps to push you in the right direction. Best regards Christian Thank you so much, Your game is epic, one of the best puzzle games out there for those that like to really work their brains, I love that I have to persevere and the aha moments have been so enjoyable, I think I already know where to look now and was almost there and kicking myself, thank you for your kind reply, again fantastic game! Your welcome, if you need more hints just ask, day 3 will also be a hard nut to crack. I made it to the library, thank you so much, I was going down the right path but doubted myself so your help put me back on it again, Iâve never felt so much satisfaction from an adventure game before and I think that not being able to cheat has made this game extra special, your vague hints are the perfect level of guidance, no doubt il be stumped again at some point:-) I'm glad you made it. I'm not a big fan of walkthroughs, they almost always spoil the experience for me. I prefer hints. :-) help stuck again. This game is super challenging like you said. Am in the room in university. Found clue on card and now canât do anything else to get out. Grrr frustrated. --- Warning spoilers below --- Try some magnification. Best regards Christian With out giving away to much ive magnified two items that have accepted magnification. One from drawer and the corpse.Iâve tried magnifying everything but still canât leave Iâve even tried items in box x --- Warning spoilers below --- There are multiple hotspots on the corpse. Best regards Christian yes I did it am in Mexico.Phew that was hard to find. That was brilliant so glad Iâve completed it but gutted itâs over. When will part 2 be out canât wait to Play and see where story goes. Sorry, I can't give you a release date for part 2, my games are always ready when they are ready. ð Best regards Christian loving the game. Just need help Iâve got the robe but stuck on going further. Stuck after university police out of office and Canât get key Did you try the hints I gave Bing55 a couple of posts below this post? Best regards Christian yes put phone in envelope but canât give it to the cop. Would love another hint please. Been on this for months on and off and canât give it up also tried interacting with everything item to item etc Ok another vague hint. --- Warning spoilers below --- Take a closer look at your phone. Best regards Christian Thankyou got it. Wow relief now I can play on. Brilliant game by the way. Just the sort of game I love and hard to get many like this. So glad managed to get help After searching for ages and didnât give up. Thanks for reply. help! How do I get the day to change so I can get to the bank? Iâve done everything I know of to do! On each day there are several tasks that have to be performed before you can advance to the next day. On day 2, unraveling the bank location is only one of these. That's why it's hard to say what exactly you are missing here, I can't send PM's on itch so please contact me by mail at contact@cunum.com if you are in desperate need of help. Best regards Christian Hi Christian, really enjoying the game but Iâm stuck and wondering if itâs a bug. Iâm in Glockeâs office but it wonât let me leave without my phone, but the phone is nowhere to be found. Cheers Hi there, you are stuck on day 3 I presume, after you picked up the police badge? If so the phone should be in the envelope on the table. thanks yes I am- I can see an envelope on the table but canât interact with it... I have another envelope in my inventory because the professor gave me another one (I was trying to figure out what to do earlier and went through the same dialogue), so maybe thatâs why? Lol ok, yeah seems to be a bug, she shouldn't be able to hand out multiple envelopes, I'll see that this is fixed in the next version. I think there's still a way for you to progress with this corrupt game state because of the bug BING55 reported a couple days ago: First tap on the divine comedy book in the toolbox. When you are in the book scene hard exit (force close) the application, don't exit over the menu, just kill the app, e.g in iOS or android swipe the application up, on windows use task manager etc. When closed, start the app again and press resume game in the menu, you are back at the book scene. Now press the white X on bottom right and you are warped back to the bookstore and not trapped in the police office anymore. To get back your phone enter the private room of the bookstore and grab it (like you already did on day 1) from the desk. After that the game state is valid again and you can proceed. Awesome thanks so much, it worked! Really glad I can keep going with the game. Thanks for making it - itâs got everything: challenges and itâs really funny too. Please keep making games. Cheers :) I'm glad it worked. Thanks for reporting the bug, have fun and stay safe. I got stuck on day 3 after came out the university.The police is out of the office.And the female professor won't give me the key.Also can't figure out how to open the ancient pendant.Completely have no idea what to do next. The university puzzle requires some rather abstract problem solving. I'm only giving out vague hints here, because I don't want to spoil the puzzling fun. After all, besides the story, that's what adventures are all about. So be aware, like with the other hints, this puzzle will still be hard as f***. Best regards Christian --- Warning spoilers below --- As the university professor told you, she will only hand out the key to a police officer. As the police officer told you, he won't let you inside the police office without Glocke's approval. Pay attention to the item the professor gave you, Item - Item interaction is possible. I put my phone in the envelope and gave it to the cop at the front desk, but when I got back to the bookstore, the phone was on the desk again. Is that a bug? Hi there, just checked it, you are right, thanks for reporting these. Both strange occurrences are bugs indeed, you can ignore these, they are not game breaking and should not happen. You shouldn't be able to pick up the phone again at the bookstore after you gave it away. I'll see they are fixed in the next version. Best regards Christian Will this bug affect the next step of the game? Because nothing new happened after I handed over the envelope and the phone. No, the bug won't affect progress, it's just a little confusing for users who discover it. Just placing the phone into the police office won't get you inside, there is still another step you have to perform. And when I put the pendant on the rusty barrel in front of the iron door, Peter would show up and talk to me.Is that a bug? Yeah, it's a wrongly triggered dialogue, this shouldn't happen, you can ignore this. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for reporting. Best regards Christian Judging from Steam and elsewhere it looks like nobody is currently playing this game. --- Warning spoilers below --- I solved the coordinates puzzle and now have a gate which does not open, other objects that you can't interact with. Obviously there is something more to do as I can't visit the hotel. The only possibly clues might be the plaques and flags. The stuff from the shore does not help in any way. The tower also does not allow any interaction. Is it a another case of missing a hotspot somewhere? I have spent ages looking for some action I am allowed, but nothing works. When future actions are not apparent, I start to wonder if a bug might be a factor. There are always some active players because it's running on 5 different platforms, but you can imagine, a game like this is very niche and caters to a very specific crowd. When all three parts are complete, I plan to release a Definite Edition with all parts included as well as a hint system (like hotspot highlighting), so it can appeal to a broader audience. At the moment this is a game for hardcore enthusiasts only, I hope the description is clear on that. Another hint, but be aware, day 3 will not be easier, maybe a bit more guided. Best regards Christian --- Warning spoilers below --- There are no bugs ð¤ª, well not in this case. The most obvious gateway is not always the correct one, sometimes you have to look to your left and right to find what you are looking for. Lol I'm starting to sound like a tibetan monk. Stuck in the game trying to work out what coordinates to key into mobile phone. No help seems to exist on the web. Seems a shame if there are no clues in game as to where to get values for the blanked out numbers on the letter, and forced to give up. Ok I'll give you two vague hints, because most players seem to struggle with this puzzle. But be aware, even with the hints this puzzle will be hard to crack. Best regards Christian --- Warning spoilers below --- Pay close attention to the quote at the front of the letter, you are probably missing an item. Inventory interactions are possible on different hotspots of the letter. these hints still did not help me and have been stuck on coordinates for a year now and Iâve given up all hope on the game I have tryed so many possibilities and still canât solve it! Even with your hints Iâve read iam still massively stuck ??? Hi, - SPOILER - are you on day 1 or 2? If you are stuck on day 1 you should take a very close at your desk in the bookstore, the letter puzzle doesnât have to be solved to finish day 1. If you are already on day 2 you can use the razor blade on multiple hotspots of the letter and you can use the letter on another inventory item you might be missing. To get it try the quote at the front of the letter on the book database. Best regards Christian Looks and sounds interesting to me. However I have to admit while I find the overall graphical style very appealing I don't like the filter. Is there a way to play the game without the filter? I'm sorry , this is not possible at the moment. The filter is meant to recreate the pixel art style of the classic adventure era without an actual pixelation of the screen. But that's definitely a good idea to be able to switch between modern and classic style. After distribution (Steam and Android are still missing) is done I'll implement a switch in the options for this. Best regards Christian</TEXT>

Diamond and Triforce in 35:41. Great game!!!!! code source pleasss I LOVE that bottle reference, awesome game just got the tri-force, this game is awesome good game Absolutely loved this! Cool idea and well polished. The music rocks too! I found a jewel, a bottle, and for some reason the Triforce! LOL! :) Very solid mechanics Good! REally fun! wish it was longer Itâs good game. Kinda feel like old retro game which what I like about this game. Hope you make longer version Great game. It feels like there is a lot of polish. Thanks! Nice work, clean game with a simple idea. Please fix the glitch where the tip of the spear brakes off and you can't do anything. Loved it i loved, very good game, i love short puzzle games. A really solid game; clean pixel art, good sound design, good balance between speed, precision and planning. Satysfying. Hola, buen juego p ara hacer speedruns HEY it will be a perfect game for mobile, a better version of Tomb of the Mask. Port it! I'm interested in publishing a full version of this game. Let's get in contact. A great puzzle game! I played this as part of a pack of 8 Itch.io games on my Twitch channel. I think one thing a lot of puzzle games struggle with is teaching you the mechanics without explicitly saying it. This game does that beautifully, with certain mechanics like the explosive barrel or the red enemies. I liked the progression, although I did find the difficulty spike between certain rooms. This might just be me though. Overall a great short little puzzle game. Awesome game! I played through it twice. first time was about 15 minutes and i missed the bottle so i played through again to get all secret levels and better time. super fun!! please consider making more levels or a sequel! either way ill be following your future work. Keep it up! Awesome Game!!! GREAT PUZZLES!!! took me 7:08 to finish the game!!! Por alguna razon cuando pasa esto ya no puedes moverte Ya estÃ¡ corregido en la nueva versiÃ³n :) I rate it 7/10, I like level 1-6 (maybe not 5), 7, 8, and 11 minus the rightmost barrel being unnecessary. Id like if enemies were harder to deal with rather than just a puzzle element and for new movement and combat options to be introduced, and obviously some more puzzle mechanics, ill list some ideas here: ground pound cancel, pull dead or alive enemies towards you, an enemy who also has a spear that functions like the player (could slice through lanterns to try and kill the player or there are special lanterns this enemy could break but not the player so you have to bait the enemy) where the enemy is killed by slicing through there spear where they would turn into a regular enemy, an enemy that you bounce off of if you hit it with your spear (can be used to reach places normally inaccessible to the player) and takes some amount of spear hits to kill and it would attack by throwing exploding barrels to telegraphed locations. I think having challenge routes that award badges or cosmetics would be cool if some of these mechanics wouldnt be good for casual mobile players if you were to make this a mobile game. does anyone have a better time than this? please let me know what your route is you can beat level 10 without breaking the wall by killing the red as intended but collect the key right after the explosion then wa(drag)d(drag)asd you can beat level 12 by cutting the first 2 lanterns then cutting right on the third one, dragging, left, down going through where the explosion from the middle barrel broke the left stone of the two to get down. making the right barrel useless you can go over the last guy in level 13 without killing him obvious fast routes for level 1-6 for 7 i killed top then went down left blocked hole then backstabbed through there, rest is obvious for 8 i pushed the barrel down to the second highest platform and went asdss, left until ws will break the platform and keep you on the right part, a(drag)dsdwasawd 9 is obvious 10 is obvious then drag on the left side above the locked door and go right once you dropped to the space between above and below the locked door with my route 247 is possible i think I haven't tried to without the secret lvls. but my time in 100% is 10:57 I really enjoyed the game, a really good mechanic and a simple but cool art style :D Hey, i have done a game review of your work here: https://saphereye.wordpress.com/2021/09/24/next-gen-mobility/ Hey, this is really cool. Thank you so much!!! This game was great <3 good job. Nice game. You did it!! really nice Hello. Great game indeed. I am reporting a BUG. First level with fire, the second lantern next to the red container, when we shoot toward them we get stuck in between the two, the game jams and we need to restart. THank you. P.S. I wish there was a go back 1 move button. And too short... :( un gran juego, creo que la mecÃ¡nica da para mÃ¡s, los niveles estÃ¡n bien pensados en su mayorÃ­a. aunque creo que hay algunas cosas que se podrÃ­an pulir. Me divertÃ­ mucho jugÃ¡ndolo :) Sorry, but i think this game fails about the jam theme because this game is so similary to the mobile game called "Tomb of the mask" is the same game basically. Only the graphic section is nice. It's so good! It feels great, I love the look and the mechanics, and it's just awesome. Greatest game! Great game! If you are going to make this a complete game, you have to port it to android almost obligatorily. I can imagine myself playing this game in my spare time from my cell phone. Amazing game. loved it :D this game is fantastic!! this grame is crazy well done !!</TEXT>

<TITLE>DEVELOPER'S BLISS</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Taunts can be a roadblock for new game developers. Taunts force new game developers to take up big projects and end up delivering nothing. My theme for #BadaSoch is to bring this familiar experience every developer goes through. "Developer's Bliss" gives you the opportunity to play as developer and answer these taunts with bullets. Download the file and extract and run the exe file to play. Hope you enjoy. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. MGC_Vlad a minute ago I played your game and made a video about it. I love how simple and pleasant it is. However, I could not figure out most of the things(for example how to jump or what i have to do to survive the first wave,) and I did not know how to open the help menu again. My record is 250 seconds. If you want to cut your game out of the video, let me know. However, if you like the video, I make similar videos every day. I will be happy if you subscribe. Anyway, I enjoyed playing your game. particle effect is very nice in the game Love the visuals and effects in the game !! Thanks a lot. True feedbacks are always appreciated.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Marooned in Chaos  - Developer Commentary</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable abandoned game project for Windows I worked on this silly physics game for too long, and want to move on to other things. In order to get some sort of value off this project, I recorded a bunch of commentary about the game that you can access in game. It's technically a beatable game, missing a couple big things, and a few small things; but in the end it just wasn't fun enough to play (or fun enough to work on lol). Here's our YouTube Channel sometimes we make stuff and things. Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hey, what's up? Hey! Randomly remembered really liking Odyssey of the Cog back during the wowie game jam and checked out your other games. Played through How to Open a Locked Chest, Why is Office Coffee so Bad, Tanks for the memories, and this game to completion. I am a huge fan of all of them and love the weird mix of comedy and unsettling tones you've got going on in your games. The developer commentary was great and very interesting. Thanks for making the games and hope you keep making more awesome stuff! Thank you! We're really glad you liked them!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Breakapede - Solo Developer</TITLE>
<TEXT>A fun combination of Breakout and Centipede! Destroy all the blocks before they make it to the bottom of the screen! Controls Left/Right arrow keys - Move Paddle Developer Notes This is a fun little project I did to see what would happen if you combined the main game mechanics of two 80's Atari games. I personally really like the design of having the blocks moving while also having to manage the ball. It gives the game another level of intrigue when you have to manage to hit the ball with the paddle while also trying to angle it to try and hit the moving blocks. I get so excited when I see the ball approaching the incoming blocks and hoping the angle is just right for the ball to hit! Even when I miss it just makes me want to try again!

<TITLE>Developer's Day Off</TITLE>
<TEXT> Developer's Day Off is an in-progress puzzle platformer which allows the player to modify its own internals in a psudo game engine. Click on objects to view their inspector, and toggle their components on and off to see what happens! Our hope is that experimenting with these mechanics will give players a sense of how games function internally, and make game development a less intimidating prospect.

I have discovered some bugs! 1: If you build up enough speed and ram into a wall, you can clip into it a bit. This lets you scale walls that you shouldn't be able to get up. Repro steps: Hold a direction for a bit (~1 second is enough I think?) Jump (while still holding down the directional button) Have the jump be interrupted due to hitting a wall Spam jump button to climb 2: If you jump onto the corner of a ground ledge just right (it's really not that precise), you get a bit stuck, and you can hold a direction to build up speed, which lets you cross gaps that you shouldn't be able to cross. It tended to shoot me to the left, but I did get it to shoot the player to the right once. Repro steps: Jump onto the corner of a platform (ground) such that the player sprite is only about half on the ground Observe that holding a direction key does not move the player After holding a directional key for long enough, enough speed is built up that the player becomes unclipped. I've observed that the player tends to slide to the left a bit as a warning sign that the player is about to be ejected. (P.S. I found your game by doing some playtesting at GDC. Still an awesome concept . :) I can't get the "koopa" enemy to leave the room!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Isolated Outpost - Solo Developer</TITLE>
<TEXT>Isolated Outpost is a game where you need to find your way off of a far away moon! Find the key to exit the building and defeat the enemies to get to your ship and escape the moon! Best played in Full Screen! Controls Mouse - Look Around Space - Jump Left Click - Attack WASD - Move E - Interact Escape - Main Menu Developer Notes This was extremely fun to make and a fun way to practice my Level Design and programming skills! I put a little bit of everything into the game, making the first half of the game a first-person platformer and the second half a third-person action adventure game. When approaching designing the levels, I tried to keep in mind how a moon base might actually look and function. For example, there is an area in the back of the base that is used from power generation, to the right there are the vehicles and garages, and the spaceship landing pad is in front of the front entrance so people can easily access it when then come and land. My personal philosophy when it comes to level design is to always keep in mind the world and its potential lore when designing anything. If something about a level doesn't make sense logically, then it could take the player out of the moment and lessen their experience. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Town Developer is a puzzle game with tower defense mechanics. Look as those cities on the verge of environmental collapse! Only your smarts can keep them running. Plan urban environment and allow necessary traffic to reach goals while keeping your impact at the minimum. Be clever and at times be quick, by utilizing the free space for your buildings and ordering waves of vehicles. This games was designed and completed in two weeks as an experiment on the idea of a TD game where instead of killing blobs you try to save them and influence them before they reach the base. Started as a prototype, it now features 14 levels with challenging scenarios that constantly introduce new elements to the playing field. Town Developer is provided as is and free of charge. Any reported issues with the game running or being badly balanced will be addressed. However, as an experiment, there are no current plans to continue developing it.

<TITLE>A Developer's Adventure</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Most developers started with nothing, usually with the idea of creating something great - and nothing more. With time opportunities revealed themselves and you learned new skills, new programming languages. If you continue this idea of growth you can see a bright future. You can become a CEO of a giant development firm. Who knows, maybe you will pile riches with ease. If you don't want to wait for that to happen, this game will lead you through all those experiences in a classical clicker game. In this clicker game a new ressource is added. With upgraded actions you gain SKILL, which has an influence on the probability of success. Just like knowledge determines your success in real life programming. If you don't succeed with an action you will lose half of what you would have gained. This means that you CAN in fact lose. If you do, don't worry, you can start from scratch again. :D Every action (sentential calculus, assembler and c# programming, working with a small dev group and leading a programming company) has four upgrades representing ways of getting better in each task: trial and error, video tutorials, participating at a Ludum Dare and professional support. In order to successfully "complete" the game we want you to get to 1.000.000! All of this follows just one big goal: piling money as much as possible! PS: Don't worry if your upgrades don't show the time saving any more. Unfortunately I had no time getting the formatting to the point where there are no visual bugs. That may get changed in a future version :D Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Software Developer Idle</TITLE>
<TEXT>You are a software developer and you're tired of working for someone else all the time, only making what they want you to make, and never making the stuff you want to. Never working on your own projects. Well, your time has come. Finally. You're starting your own business with what you have in the bank: È¿ 1. Ok, so you're broke, but you can still do this. You just need to start doing this "nights & weekends". Once you get a few projects completed, you'll be able to afford to spend less time "at the office" and more time working on your own stuff. Also, you'll be able to hire people to do more things for you. You'll also have to start managing your resources. This includes servers and attacks on your stuff. What? Did you think you weren't going to get noticed by hackers or have to deal with hardware failures? Pfft! This isn't a game, it's your life! You've wanted to do this "forever", so you have to deal with the bad as well as reap the rewards. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Too short. Thanks for playing! I wrote this in a week, so I didn't put a whole lot of content in. It was more of a "proof of concept", but I'll definitely think about adding more to it!

<TITLE>Celeste Classic (ZX Spectrum Next)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Celeste Classic is an iconic platform game, originally developed by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry, for the Pico-8 fantasy console ( link ). They later developed Celeste, a highly acclaimed game that any platformer lover should play ( link ). This is a remake for the Spectrum Next, made with the intention of being as faithful as possible to the original. It is NOT an official version. I asked Noel Berry for permission for a remake and he kindly granted it. Help Madeline climb Celeste Mountain, through 30 screens of increasing difficulty. Jump, climb walls, dash into the void. There are four directional controls (left-right-up-down) and two actions (jump and dash). You can redefine keys if the default map is not for you. A kempston joystick connected to the joystick port 1 may be used (simultaneously with the keyboard). I like to use a Megadrive gamepad, so I have two action buttons available. Jump into the air, Madeline will respond to directional buttons while airborne. If you push against a wall while falling by its side, fall speed will diminish. Also, you can jump from the wall, an even chain jumps. The dash is the most powerful movement, but it can be used only once until you touch floor. Don't forget to point the dash direction with the directional buttons, it will make a great difference! The game has infinite lives and if you die, you restart the level. Keep passing levels and you will get to the end. If you reach the final level in less than one hour, the game will let you put your name in the hall of fame (which is saved, as the redefined keys). It's a difficult game, but not impossible. With practice, it can be completed in a few minutes. During development, with all that testing, I have become quite good at it. On a ZX Spectrum Next / N-Go / Xberry Pi, just copy the celeste.nex file to your SD card and run it from the browser. Celeste for Pico-8 runs at 30 Fps. Celeste for Next runs at 25 Fps at the standard Next mode (50Hz), so it's a bit slower (some will thank this). But the Next can be set to run at 60Hz (see manual ), and the game will run as fast as in Pico-8. If you want to try 60Hz running from emulator, use the scripts ending in "-60". I have tried to create a faithful port of the Pico-8 original. It's been a somewhat difficult task, because although the Pico-8 seems like low power console, it really isn't. It's a fantasy console which requires some power to run (700MHz CPU and at least 512Mb RAM). Compared to the Next (28MHz Z80 with 2Mb RAM), it's a huge machine. Pico-8 uses the Lua programming language, and internally uses 16.16 fixed point for numbers. I have been able to implement all gameplay and movement logic using 8.8 fixed point, using 16 bit integers on the Z80. At least, the graphic system of the Next (layer2, tiles, sprites) seems to get the work done. I have provided the source code of this game as a downloadable ZIP. It is also available from the github repo . Celeste Classic for Spectrum Next has been developed and tested using: The game should work on other versions / firmwares.

Cada vez que veo Celeste, me acuerdo de Cave Story (Doukutsu Monotagari) que ha sido portado a una infinidad de plataformas. SerÃ­a maravilloso si pudiera ser portado. Muchas gracias David Nice game! Thank you for playing! Hello David. We are a new EO team and we would like to ask if we could use a similar main character and environment for our game? We hope you will respond as quickly as possible thanks in advance Hello EO, it's not me who you should ask. Literally in the first paragraph of the game description, the original developers are credited. It's them who you should ask, Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. I asked them and they said go ahead ;-) Of course we know, but I wanted to know your permission to use similar graphics for the game, including the environment Ok, no problem from my side, I took the graphics from the original pico 8 version (asking them first), so there's no reason why you can't do the same. This looks marvellous, David. Thanks for this, can't wait to try it on my Next, I hope you'll make more games for it. Cheers. Nice game!!! It looks amazing! Gran juego para Next!

<TITLE>Celeste Classic</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game An unofficial port of Celeste Classic from PICO-8 to Playdate . Download the game and sideload it to your Playdate device. (You can refer to the official Sideloading Playdate games documentation.) If you donât own a Playdate, you can play in the Playdate Simulator on Windows, macOS or Linux . Download and install the Playdate SDK . Place the .pdx file in the PlaydateSDK/Disk/Games/ folder. (The .pdx available for download has been compiled on macOS. If you play on another system, youâll need to recompile the game. The source code is available on GitHub .) Celeste Classic on Playdate was made to be as faithful as possible to the original game on PICO-8. But here are a few notable changes: The game is in black and white only. A lot of visual elements have an outline to make them more readable. But this does not impact their original hitbox. The game is rendered at 256Ã240 from the original 128Ã128. Four pixel lines are cropped at the top and bottom of the screen. The game can be played at its original resolution by disabling the Fullscreen option available in the gameâs menu. Assist mode is available under the gameâs menu. This allows players to skip a level, change the game speed to 0.5Ã, get infinite dashes, and enable invincibility. If assist mode is used during a run, a mention is added on each level in the lower right corner, as well as in the pause screen and the final score screen. Celeste Classic is an original game on PICO-8 by Noel Berry and Maddy Thorson. PICO-8 and the PICO-8 font are the property of Lexaloffle Games . Playdate is a registered trademark of Panic . The Playdate port was done by RÃ©mi Parmentier . Thanks to Alex Larioza for help and tips on performance optimizations. And thanks to the wonderful people on Discord ( orkn, Grhmhome, Drew-Lo, Gamma, Kiwi, Tristianski, jeffamphetamines, PizzaDev, Kucromy, GuvBubbs, NickSr, Andrew, DoctorMikeReddy, natch, rasith, Braillynn, fnc12 ) for their feedback. This project is under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

In theory, it could (as both PICO-8 and Playdate share support for Lua). In practice, this port includes a lot of custom rework for performance on Playdate which I'm not sure could be automatized for a general purpose PICO-8 player. What about a framework for porting games over like the N64 recompiler for PC? Great game. Any plans to port the sequel as well? This is an incredible port and I love playing it on my Playdate. I've beaten it twice and will definitely finish it again. I loved this game, and seeing it in this version just proves how amazing it is. Even without the colors, it's a masterpie maybe even more than before! I can't seem to sideload it on my PlayDate. Whenever I upload it and refresh on the PlayDate it doesn't come up. Any possibility that I can try with 1.0.2 of Celeste please? You can find older releases on GitHub: https://github.com/hteumeuleu/celeste/releases But Iâd be surprised if this made any difference. How do you side load ? (Online or via USB)? What is your PlaydateOS version? Online via the PlayDate site. Iâm on the latest firmware of PlayDate. (2.4.1) Update: I tried v1.0.2 and that version worked. Thatâs super weird… but Iâm glad you got it sorted out! love the port! how hard do you think would it be to port something like foreverred using this as the base? Its another pico-8 game based on celeste, though with many new levels and a couple new mechanics. Thanks for your kind words. I would say porting a mod shouldn't be too hard considering most of the engine is done and should likely be the exact same. So the work would mostly consist in porting the assets (sprites and tiles) and levels. I'm currently working on an update and I'm thinking about a way to implement mods (either specific ones made for Playdate or ones from Pico-8 cartridges). I'll see if this goes anywhere. interesting! thanks for the reply and good luck on the update Absolutely excellent and what I consider the best and most "real" game on Playdate thus far. What a great port. Can you give a bit more information on the port process? How hard would it be to port other pico games to PD? Thank you for your kind words. My process was to first grab all game code and assets from the PICO-8 using command line exports from the PICO-8 dev kit. Then, since both PICO-8 and Playdate can use Lua, I polyfilled all functions used in the game in PICO-8 to work similarly on the Playdate. But this turned out to be terribly slow (around 5 FPS) and not very legible (not everything looked good straigtaway in 1-bit). So then I started the slow process of optimizing things part by part, both in code and graphism. Most of the time, this meant replacing things draw frame by frame in PICO-8 by using Sprites in the Playdate SDK. You can go through the commit history on Github of how it went ( https://github.com/hteumeuleu/celeste/commits/main?after=dd20c9898cbac5b25a40aa8...) . This is seriously so amazing! Iâm only a few screens in, but you did an awesome job porting this to the Playdate from what Iâve seen so far. Controls and movement feel just as smooth and precise as the original! I do miss the original soundtrack, but I understand why it had to be changed and I can always just listen to it on my phone while playing if I want (not that thereâs anything wrong with the music in the port, Iâm just used to the original) Thank you for your kind words. However, please note that the music in this port is the exact same as the original one. This is a port of the original Celeste Classic for PICO-8, not a port or demake of the popular Celeste game on modern consoles. It was made by the same two core people than the Celeste game on consoles, Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. They deserve all the credits for the controls, movement and soundtrack. ohhhh ok, sorry for the confusion Hey there. Thanks for your kind comment. Iâm not very familiar with Terraria, but by the look of it, it doesnât seem like the source code is available, and the game looks graphically very far from the Playdateâs constraints. Iâm sure a demake would be possible but I donât feel up for it. Is the FPS counter supposed to be on in the shipping version? I assume thatâs whatâs in the upper left corner? The FPS counter appears or disappears whenever you do a full crank turn. (But in practice it toggles just by hitting the zero degree spot which is upwards.) I should probably move this to its own option menu screen at some point. Thanks for your feedback. Awesome port, I thoroughly enjoyed playing it on the playdate. I did notice one "bug" though. In the original pico 8 version, collecting strawberries gives you back your boosts, like balloons. However in this version, you don't get your boosts back from strawberries. This is pretty unnoticeable unless you are trying to speedrun the game, in which it means some strategies are broken. Great port though, thanks for bringing this game to playdate! Oh shoot! I never would have realized this. There was indeed a bug related to this. I fixed this and pushed a new version (1.0.2). Thank you! Awesome! I actually found one more bug. This one is even more of an edge case, and I'm surprised I even found it. On 700M, if you are on a cloud and the cloud brings you into the spikes, the spikes will just push you off the cloud instead of killing you. I tested on the Pico version and the spikes should kill you. Oh wow, thanks for reporting this. Collisions with spikes is indeed something I had to heavily work on to improve performance. And I guess I messed something up here… I'll look into this and get you updated here as soon as I'll fix it. Thanks again for reporting this bug. I was able to fix this issue and pushed a new release (1.0.3). Thanks again for your interest and for reporting this issue. ð¯ Thank you! you should make Celeste 2 as well Thanks, I'll think about it! Man I want this stupid little device so bad. Just install the emulator to play its games this is awesome! What is this, a grand adventure about climbing a mountain and finding your true identity for ants? Jokes aside this is an incredible remake. Kudos!! I can't get past the first screen lmao. Killer job porting tho Same here! And I don't want to bypass anything with assists, nor do I want to seek out spoilers, but I feel like I'm totally missing something. I read a comment above about the crank above and maybe that's what I'm missing... `A` is for Jump. `B` is for a Dash. If you feel stuck, you can try looking for a let's play on Youtube to see the path you're supposed to take. Un grand merci ð This is so cool Just to be clear: this is a port of the original Celeste game by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. Iâm only responsible for bringing this to Playdate (making both the technical and graphical adjustments required to make it work). you should make a YouTube channel and document how you did it. Excellent work, another game to play during call shifts :) oh yeah everything seems fine here wait a minuteð¤£ Awesome!!! I loved playing it on Playdate. This is awesome! No way. Wow, what an effort!! Well done can't wait to see you next project!! Well done!!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Celeste Classic 2</TITLE>
<TEXT>A PICO-8 platformer about hiking around a mountain, made in three days for Celeste's third anniversary. Use the arrow keys, X, and C Made by Maddy Thorson , Noel Berry , and Lena Raine . Testing by Kevin Regamey . Soundtrack: Bandcamp Source Code: Github Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I am disappointed with the utter lack of secrets in very obvious places The grappling hook is so finicky that it makes this game hard to enjoy. Holy hell I was looking at it the wrong way. Just discovered the wallclimb thing using the grappling hook I was pressing Z twice and cancelling the grapple. God I'm stupid. Oh my god bruh. I didn't know I could HOLD X. Very fun, but no real room for artificial challenges. fun but really easy game I hope that was all the strawberries lol celeste 2 real Incredible. The music is amazing. The control feels just like what a sequel to Celeste (Classic or not) would bring. I love that the first two levels taught me how to grapple and what the mechanics are incredibly quickly. But err, it's hard, especially on a phone with PICO-8 controls and using thumbs. I fell down a cave and the only way up apparently is chaining jumps out of the floating grapple thingies. I don't think I can complete this in 18 minutes lol. Amazing game, can't believe this was a 3 day project. I cannot figure out how to hold the DAMN SNOWBALLS I can't stand the arrow keys controls so i used a gamepad, not bad, i liked the grapling hook mechanic. this game is completable in 18 minutes on your first full run xD not the hardest game but im sad that i killed myself at the end finicky... so hard i die 903 time bro I somehow can't pass the 3:40 mark After 30 minutes I'm still messing up which button is jump and which button is grappel (-_-") this game sucks its easy bro def said this after not being able to beat level 2 bold of you to assume he even beat level 1 bro wait for celeste classic 3 I kinda suck lol I extremely suck but dang is it compelling first time finishing it! tho not the first time playing it, i kept accidentally restarting the game... such a cool game tho!!!! Done With 16 Strawberries and 350 Deaths . Time = 00 : 40 :31 Time To Replay this Masterpiece im literally diamond sigma dude its insane I played this some time ago. It's tough but it's very satisfying when you overcome a challenging obstacle! The trick is to never go on a hike with Maddy Thorson IRL I didn't know this existed until now, this is awesome I want to kill myself in glacial caves, before the first flag, you can actually grab the snowball how do you beat glacial caves before first flag? EDIT: how the HELL do you beat glacial caves in general??? you can actually grab the snowball thanks I love this game!! But boy was the last few strawberries hard to get and I've apparently at least missed 2 of them. Oh heavens, time to replay... i died 601 times on my first win i got stuck on stage 2 for so long i forgot the name The game protagonist kind remind me of Dandara Even though it's just a silly little PICO-8 game, this is one of my favorite games of all time. I just really like it. took 36 min to beat and 450 deaths AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</TEXT>

Also, when you get a berry and die, the berry respawns instead of staying collected 1800m cloud is broken lol on 1800 M, the cloud seems to be going in reverse Overall this is functional, but the movement is much slower than the normal version, additionally many strategies that are easy in the original just straight up don't work in this game. Don't play this if you want the berries or if you want to speed run the game. Its functional, but just don't play it. The original is much better. hey man, thanks for playing it, this was a quick fun (extended) Weekend Project, i ported this in 3 days to have fun, the major difference is that it runs at 60fps (intentional) while the original runs at 30. besides that im sure many more little difference might exist but its not meant as a replacement to the original. It was a fun little project :) thanks for feedback! When you get the green powerup Madeline doesn't change colors really? it should! fixed :) awesome This runs a lot smoother than the original, amazing thank you!</TEXT>

Controls: Z, X, Arrow keys, and Return to Pause I learned a lot making this mod. Please leave Feedback and screenshots of your final times below! The game can also be found here: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=129671#p Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Super fun!!! All 16 Strawberries. 12 Deaths. Time 4 Mins Fun Pretty fun! Way easier than the original Lani's Trek, haha. Though I was always a bigger fan of dashing than Lani's grapple thing. think I did alright I'm pretty sure I've soft locked myself. I'm in the sky playforms section with the spike posts. I managed to collect the strawberry by backtracking to the springpad, but I think I needed it to go forward. Yup, went back. I think it's the very last strawberry that you can get stuck on if you collect it in the wrong way. I FOUND A WAY TO BEAT THIS ROOM WITHOUT THE BERRY! if you dash into the bottom right corner of a spiked block from the underneath, and spam jump, it gives you the wall jump off of the spike, and if you conserve one dash, you can barely make it to the balloon. WE BALL!!!!!! I speedran this and ended with a 2:28 after a lot of tries. edit: I GOT 2:26 AND IT WAS UNOPTIMISED later that same day: I GOT 2:21 SOMEHOW pretty hard on the last section but 06:31 28 deaths 9 minutes 6 seconds, all berries, 66 deaths Nice! Hope you had fun! nice job. it's definitely easier with double jump Thanks! I kinda want to put Lani in Celeste Classic to see what thats like...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Play the sequel to this mod here Farland is a celeste classic mod that adds new mechanics, music, and a ton of other things. there is no gemskip sadly. but if you have no experience with celeste classic then you should play it, because if you haven't played celeste classic some of these levels may be too hard, and its also just a great game also warning the game may lag on the web, so I would personally recommend one of the downloadable versions Credits to Matt Thorson and Noel Berry for celeste classic and to RubyRed for the new music and to the Celeste classic discord it's an amazing server full of supportive people Just download the zip file for which platform you are on, unzip the file, and run it Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. update: that wasn't too bad actually wavedash.ppt decided to trigger trauma 6:44 9:47 new pb Damn that was tough! Great game! Nice YESSSSSS! The final level requires a spike clip and is so ridiculously difficult. GGS how For which part? nice job, i just looked up a tutorial for final level 100 % now going for the secret ending my best record cut 30 seconds how do you get to the secret levels? help I'm traped in the level 2700 ESCAPISM IS A PRICK. beating the game in under 6 minutes is even more of a prick yes!! how de you get to the ??? levels WTH there is literally a wall of spikes blocking my exit and movement to exit NVM i found out how how So, long story short, dashes make you move and instant burst of speed that can carry you through spikes if there is no wall blocking you at the end of the dash, similar to at the top of the match and the floating spikes spike clip, that's the term escapism was tough, but i did it GOOD ON YOU. I CAN'T how do i go to the next lvl in practice if you mean with the practice mode then you can use the f and s keys in order to the next and previous level I GOT PURE SUMBIT!!!! You get it from beating all of the ??? stages by dashing into the bottom left corner in one of the double dash levels gosh dang it is hard ask for help if needed! Also got all berrys lol hell's this level supposed to work Finally beat it omg that's painful FINALLY!!!!!!!!! just beat it, god that was pain I love the mod but I can not get past ??? I've never seen that level before. Maybe you should try resetting it? You need to dash into the spikes I don't know exactly how it works but you need to do somthing like that above the red orb If you need any more help just ask your dash is longer than the spike hitbox so you can dash trough them if youre careful hello there! celeste classic (including mods) has some little glitches that speedrunners use to beat the game faster. you can clip through the spikes. see here for help. that mod is soo better than the original :) i'm stuck on stage 2300 m does anyone know how to go to the next level I got exactly 333 deaths!

This mod is primarily a map mod like the original although there's some new mechanics, music (thanks RubyRed), etc. If you haven't played the original Celeste classic before playing this than I highly recommend it as some of the later levels may prove to be very challenging without previous experience. Controls: Huge thanks again to RubyRed for making the entire OST of the mod, and i want to give thanks to Maddy thorson and Noel berry for the original Celeste classic . Lastly i want to thank the Celeste classic community for playtesting and also just being really supportive. Simply download and unzip the zip file for your platform and run it. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. where the [[Fifty Percent Off]] is my boy pure summit Yippee!! Pretty fun game really i want to commit unalive Really fun! 100% the game with 232 deaths holy shit wait i beat it with exactly one more death than you. i wasn't near 100% tho, i'm still proud :) I somehow didn't see the cloud in 2800 but accidentally found an exploit. If you walk onto the ledge at just the right height, the spikes won't kill you and you can get your jump back. I finished! such a good celeste mod it crashed for some reason while I was playing on a Chromebook, I had to reload which made me lose my progress the secret penguin hangout room is funny Really fun, but after an hour I got stuck at 3200 :( skill issue Could definitely use some optimizations but I think its pretty good for a first run gg, nice mod very hard for a platformer noob like me, but really fun to play! my first completion took over an hour of gameplay because i played first 16 minutes on a school computer ^w^ very fun, not the hardest, gave me evvered flashbacks on the last two levels though this was really fun, I had a vague memory of playing the original farland and this was definitely and upgrade although I loved the original mod too Full concentration. i really liked the levels with the moon in the background very pretty so good even better than the first one HOW DOES IT TAKE TWELVE GODDAMM JUMPS TO FINISH THIS GAME????!! (I used air jumps, walljumps air jumps are basically jumping right after dashing straight up, they give you a decent amount of hieght to complete some very hard levels) BRUH FARLAND TOOK ME SEVEN JUMPS LIKE WHAT??!! I would love to see a Farland V3 where you don't have ANY dash and it's like those few levels in the middle of the game. You could take some levels or make some new ones be able to be finished with no dash. It could require a little bit of speed tech (corner jumps) at the VERY end of the game but in my opinion it would be very fun) Haha that sounds like a cool idea but I definitely wouldn't make that myself, at least not as a triquel to the series. good dashless gameplay in general is pretty trick to get right so it'd take a lot of effort and a lot more supporting mechanics for a full length mod. nice! my first speedrun Woah, that's pretty fast for a first run! How do I get up to the penguins up top? You have to perform some spikeclip tech in order to get up there. Read about that here: https://celesteclassic.github.io/glossary/#spikeclip where are these penguins You know how you reach the Golden Peak? From the starting point you go left and you come to the Penguin Hideout. The penguins are there Got the secret penguin u need to first walk through the spikes on the platform than preform spike clip my full collection run!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Celeste Factory</TITLE>
<TEXT>Celeste Factory is a mod for Celeste Classic developed in a month. This is an early build only featuring one chapter, with 3 more planned. (Major Hiatus) Z to Jump X to Dash Arrow Keys to move Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Can you give us pico8 version for download ? "IM SO EXITED FOR THE NEXT AREA" I exclaimed exitedly but little did I know it was a game a gamejam game a gamejam game, that is unfinished (but TBH this is great no hate.) here's an update: i beat my previous pb by 1 second but died once(?). going back to 2000m (that's where i died), i noticed that that one death actually made me lose 4-5 seconds (this is probably very inaccurate because i used the in game timer to count). now i kinda wanna go for sub 1:35 and i want my time pb to be deathless as well anyways so i might as well go for an even better time so I decided that after getting dashless, beating the best time on any% i have seen someone get in this so far(1:38), was the next thing on my list. this screenshot is fron an hour ago and it matches the time exactly. Funny enough, i lost some time on mistakes so 1:37/36 is very well possible. My best time: when is the next chapter coming out when the dev releases it. ah, makes sense 6 sec and 9 deaths less lowered the time a little bit Just made it to 1900 dashless deathless!!! I got 1900 like 3rd try but lost most of the time on the last 2 spike jumps I am completely speechless Yeah so on my third run um this happened almost sub 16 dashless I'm going to run my head into a wall I missed the golden berry and touched the campfire on accident I found ways to beat every level dashless. Only problem is the fact that 1900 is insanely precise. At the time of writing this, I have spent well over an hour with 1000+ deaths only to 1900 dashless. My hands are starting to hurt a bit so I'll stop here for today. if anyone is interested in trying dashless themselves, I recommend trying to get the "second half" of 1900 consistently first. I managed to get near the end one time only and then died because i missed the jump like 20 times and then fell into a spike. Edit: Despite all the "mental pain" dashless causes me, I really enjoy playing this (even got golden fc) and I'm absolutely hyped for the other levels. Holy shit I made it! Found something that makes 1900 actually easy. Silly past me thinking you have to use the first spring. also hello free golden my first run of just playing I like how there are so many speedrun skips, like you can easily skip the entire last level for example Awesome mod! Love the springs mechanic (even in that diabolical last level). Would definitely check out a full version. man finish your game man My PB (i am extremely happy with this time) Total of 3454 deaths please finish this, it's a great mod! please finish this game, this is one of the best celeste classic mods i've ever seen :) Awesome game!! I hope that this gets more levels and stuff. Best celeste mod imo how do you reset your progress Until now, this is the best I can do. Nice :D very fun mod, it is really fun to get a long strawberry trail i tried doing every level dashless and i think the only ones that are impossible whitout dash are 1600, 1900, 2100 and 2400 i got 2100 but i still don't understand 1900 1900 and 2100 are possible i tried it and the only ones i think a re impossible are1600 and 240 FIX THE LAST JUMP IN THE FIRST LEVEL mo money Very nice, when are you going to finish the mod? It's super far back on the back burner, we'd love to get it done, but there's nothing planned for now Are 13 berries the max amount of berries? (Including the Golden Berry so 12 red berries) no, there is a dashless golden I found out I can do a one-way wall jump. It's a little precise, but you jump off a wall, then quickly press off the wall then hold back onto the wall. you'll turn around mid-way through and shorten your jump. Try it in places with big walls, and see if you can use it for your playthrough(s) . You found the neutral jump :V Yea I didn't know what that was calledð . But at least it was addressed... The wall jump REALLY helped during my MinimumDash%. I finished with only 7 dashes. Thanks! Good Job, I'm glad I could helpð huh I thought this was something you could only do in normal celeste When are you Finishing the mod? Projects have been coming and going. It's definitely gonna get done, but rn it's not a main priority remember to rate the game when are you going to upload the current version to the standalone ports? Just did :) great mod cool game. Awesome submission, it's rare to see this level of polish in any pico-8 cart, let alone a celeste mod. Looking forward to the next levels! I'm glad you enjoyed it! I do like to polish things a lot given the chance lol. YOOOOOOO</TEXT>

<TITLE>Celeste Old Site (ZX Spectrum Next)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Celeste Classic is an iconic platform game, originally developed by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry, for the Pico-8 fantasy console ( link ). They later developed Celeste, a highly acclaimed game that any platformer lover should play ( link ). I already did a Spectrum Next port of Celeste Classic , an unofficial but faithful remake, for which I asked permission to Noel Berry and he kindly granted it. During my research for the Pico-8 game, I came across this great mod by Amegpo . It incorporates some elements from the full Celeste game, such as tokens, dreamblocks and Badeline. As I had already made the first remake, I thought it would be great to reuse most of the code for porting this mod, just changing maps and adding a few gameplay elements. Help Madeline climb Celeste Mountain, through 30 screens of increasing difficulty. Jump, climb walls, dash into the void. There are four directional controls (left-right-up-down) and two actions (jump and dash). You can redefine keys if the default map is not for you. A kempston joystick connected to the joystick port 1 may be used (simultaneously with the keyboard). I like to use a Megadrive gamepad, so I have two action buttons available. Jump into the air, Madeline will respond to directional buttons while airborne. If you push against a wall while falling by its side, fall speed will diminish. Also, you can jump from the wall, an even chain jumps. The dash is the most powerful movement, but it can be used only once until you touch floor. Don't forget to point the dash direction with the directional buttons, it will make a great difference! The game has infinite lives and if you die, you restart the level. Keep passing levels and you will get to the end. If you reach the final level in less than one hour, the game will let you put your name in the hall of fame (which is saved, as the redefined keys). It's a difficult game, but not impossible. With practice, it can be completed in a few minutes. During development, with all that testing, I have become quite good at it. On a ZX Spectrum Next / N-Go / Xberry Pi, just copy the celeste.nex file to your SD card and run it from the browser. Celeste for Pico-8 runs at 30 Fps. Celeste for Next runs at 25 Fps at the standard Next mode (50Hz), so it's a bit slower (some will thank this). But the Next can be set to run at 60Hz (see manual ), and the game will run as fast as in Pico-8. If you want to try 60Hz running from emulator, use the scripts ending in "-60". I have tried to create a faithful port of the Pico-8 original. It's been a somewhat difficult task, because although the Pico-8 seems like low power console, it really isn't. It's a fantasy console which requires some power to run (700MHz CPU and at least 512Mb RAM). Compared to the Next (28MHz Z80 with 2Mb RAM), it's a huge machine. Pico-8 uses the Lua programming language, and internally uses 16.16 fixed point for numbers. I have been able to implement all gameplay and movement logic using 8.8 fixed point, using 16 bit integers on the Z80. At least, the graphic system of the Next (layer2, tiles, sprites) seems to get the work done. Celeste Old Site for Spectrum Next has been developed and tested using: The game should work on other versions / firmwares.

<TITLE>Celeste 1K</TITLE>
<TEXT>This was originally intended as an entry for Pico1K Jam 2024, but I wasn't able to complete it in time. It contains the first 3 levels of the game, a simple end screen with time score, and most of the original game mechanics, now running at 60FPS. Hope you enjoy playing it! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. these physics are killing me, i played too many other celeste classic mods and now this is agonizing [not a bad thing, just different] Well, I had to use lots of hacks and simplifications to get it working. It's only 1KB, so there wasn't space to tweak the physics to work exactly like the original. very cool! tried speedrunning it and got a 13.8. definitely not optimized, but I'm satisfied for now. Good time! The physics are a bit different from the original, but glad to hear they're working consistently. extremly smooth! awesome job! Thanks,ð I tend to use 60fps in pico-8 by default, as it helps smooth out the chunky low-res motion and stuttering. I realized the original game was 30fps and tried to switch to that, but even with tweaking values, everything felt sluggish, so I just stuck with 60. This is amazing! Good work. Is the source available? Thanks, There's actually no separate source code, as I code all my tiny projects in compressed form by hand. I guess that's terrible practice, but I'm not a software dev, and it lets me better monitor and control the size. I'd be happy to answer any questions or explain things if the code's too cryptic, though. Oh wait is there a way to display the source code from the web build of a pico-8 game? That's all I was looking to see! Hand-compressing is the way to go imho! Oh, okay, I thought you meant commented, long-form code. Here's a link to the code from the cart. I'm especially proud of the combined map decompression/autotiling system in about 100 chars at the beginning. ;) https://pico-8-edu.com/c=AHB4YQkpBABPcc5oa-Bzy0Bel8v-tzaA-ZMUBjJ8isIifo8DzWV4Fe... Thank you so much. This is wild. Most of it is way above my head, but very cool to dig through.</TEXT>

The only thing it feels like it is missing is a conclusive ending. Just the game by itself doesn't appear to have any application for the final answer word you mentioned even after getting all stars and hearts. Hi! Thank you for playing! The final answer word was used during the actual puzzle event to progress, but there isn't anything in the game itself for it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>arrow keys to move, z to jump, x to dash. you can change direction mid-dash! a mod of CELESTE Classic by Noel Berry and Maddy Thorson Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Now THAT was difficult. This is actually my second victory. My first totaled around 800 deaths and 90 minutes across all attempts and restarts. Out of every room, my favorites have to be 1600m and 2400m, distinguished by their high use of coffee beans and cherries. Juggling around so many objects at once is definitely difficult, but so incredibly satisfying once you manage it. Overall, great mod, unique mechanics I haven't seen anywhere else yet. This is a good and long Celeste Classic mod, but it's way too difficult (at least for me). Quite challenging, but also very rewarding. Really liked the water levels, not so much the red bean ones. I've beaten celte, can't figure out how to make it past the first jump in this game. Might want to work on some easier levels that teach the more advanced mechanics you are hoping players use. too difficult</TEXT>

I got DEATHLESS :DD I just barely got a sub hour trueskip 100%, that was stressful lol I was down to like 1 or 2 attempts on etherealization before it wasn't happening o.o also got a new deaths goal of under 500 :D omg I just got a new best time and deaths... I died once on checkpoint 2 :0 over the course of 4 days, 4.5 hours, and 2545 deaths, I did this and normal trueskip :D Edit: it was actually a lot longer that I was stuck at determination, but 4 days of recent attempts is more acurate congrats on making it to the tip of the spire! :3 I DID IT LETS GOOOOOO ...it's over. Over 3000 deaths later, though a portion are not recorded here. Over the course of weeks, I pushed for progress. And eventually, I made it. And, with that... it all comes to an end. What comes next, I wonder? In this ending so eternal... where is one to proceed? Is this... where my journey would cease entirely? ...that can't be right. After so many hours, I can't let it go to waste. But as of now, there is nothing I know I could do. So, the solution is simple: I must seek out greater challenges, ones that would further push my potential. For now, though... I will relish this victory as it is, a triumph against all odds. congrats! very few make it all the way to the other summit, but you persevered. i've been doing trueskip for fun now. this is my third victory, and... wow. wasn't expecting to get so good so fast, but here we are. i guess the same did happen for all the other major gaming challenges i've overcome, but this one... it should have been different. "i'll never do trueskip deathless, though" i think to myself. a part of me hopes i'm right, another hopes i'm wrong. I've been doing a few more runs of Trueskip. It's quite an enjoyable challenge, though one I am quite skilled at... but one particular room still escapes my grasp. "EXASPERATION", they called it... and exasperated I am indeed, by one object's making: that red balloon. Its placement is perfectly precarious, and even more perfectly deceiving. Many routes to extract its double dash appear viable, but most are either unnecessarily precise or downright impossible. I've found I've forgotten the optimal method of extracting the second dash safely, leaving me to repeat the first part of the room over and over until I rediscover it. Alas, such is the nature of challenges this grand: with too many failed attempts, frustration emerges... I will admit that this room is also extremely challenging. It's called "COORDINATION". The very top portion of this room poses the greatest challenge, as it requires extreme precision. Being the last part of the room, it is also difficult to practice it effectively, making it even more formidable. so, i was trying to do deathless, and... i actually did it!! hell yeah!! there's also a cool golden background as a reward I think I'm getting better, but idk 8/11/2025 12:36 PM Guess what? Game was a painfully hard, took me this much time and deaths to get to this point, and yet I willingly gave up on just one strawberry 10/10 Would play again i got 15 on penguin snake but I forgot to screenshot D: Gemskip in under 10 was fun I guess HELL YEAH 2 there is a special room if you get all the radishes in gemskip apparently update on the trueskip situation: this may have been a mistake HELL YEAH sub 1 hour gemskip! i'm probably never gonna do trueskip because when i tried i couldn't even get past the first room :\ "probably never gonna do trueskip" boy was i wrong smots gaming smots gaming no way smots gaming smots gaming it's been a while since I last played this, it's gotta be my favorite game of all time at the moment wow, that's high praise! thank you so much <3 I gave up on the last 4 rooms... they are way to hard for a guy like me congrats!! trueskip is no easy feat, and under two hours too! yo, congrats! trueskip is probably the most difficult challenge available among the current celeste classic mods, so there's basically nowhere to go here... but the way i see it, that just means you've reached... well, let's just say, the "summit" of your potential in this area? [LAUGH PLEASE] This is the best i could get. Edit: I just got sub 6. oh yeah how in the actual hell do you do a500 true skip? :edit nvm i got it lol but for a1100, i stuck, again... for 1100m, you have to corner jump off of the spikes to reach the wall on the other side and wall jump up. most of the tricks used in gemskip and trueskip are mentioned here: https://celesteclassic.github.io/glossary/ (check the corner jump section for 1100m) TY so much i tried for like an hour.... What do you do for 500M? I cant figure it out. and 800M you need to wall jump off of spiked walls to pass 500m and 800m (check "parity" and "spike jump" sections here: https://celesteclassic.github.io/glossary ) gg! 1:21 is an amazing first time too You could say I done good awesome Is that... ALL RADISHES DEATHLESS??? Okay, okay, WOW, that's awesome. I probably won't be able to do the same for a good while... I've tried, though, and I can confidently say this is impressive as hell. Great job! oh yeah shwam trying this again and oh awesome very fun very good what room is gem skip in? and how do i do it? most normal gemskip tech: first deathless run Holy! nice pace too! holy CONGRATS!! as someone who's done this too, i know how frustrating it is, but you did it! ive been grinding my time at work to get under 10 minutes. Very fun good job on this! : ) I can't stop playing, its the only fun i get at work new best time :3 with all turnips too the game crashed on me randomly (that was the first time that has happened) also who thinks they can beat the game without touching the ground? hm, that's odd. did it display an error message? if not it could be a browser issue you can almost do it. (getting the gems is impossible without touching the ground, but "Beginnings" is possible with 2 dashes without touching the ground. 2nd gem isn't though. 1100 is possible but it requires multiple spike clips. Everything else is possible I think. sad that i cant play the skip without a progress save YOO THE SECRET IN GRAVEYARD OF THE FALLEN IS AWESOME heres my first run getting to here thats how it go, it gets so much faster after your first run because you actually know what you are doing, i went from an hour on my first complete run to 20 minutes, and can do all berries in sub 10 Nice job, man! Also those runs were before i actually started playing celeste and now i can beat this in under 10 mins too with all berries Hey guys, try opening the chest and walking into the right wall in the first screen... s e c r e t s first gemskip, hated it. round 2! where is the snake minigame below forgotten graveyard, suicide andits not really death Thanks, at first I didn't even realize there was a hole there I just noticed that the snake computer is the computer from steam celeste where you can play celeste classic Oh yeah! You're right! *realizes how to do gemskip* OH THATS WHY THE LEVELS LOOK SO WEIRD when 500 requires 2 consecutive spike walljumps... and then there is 1100 spam z how do u change difficulty from normal I NEED EVEN MORE CHALLENGE NOW THAT I GOT SUB 20 ALL BERRIES got 8:40 yesterday gemskip or trueskip whats true ski- Oooooh you skip both gems Acually, you have to open the chest at the beginning, then not get the gem OR go up, go right instead, right through the wall. Edit: it's extremly hard. Don't say I didn't warn you. couldn't even get past first screen, screens are insanely long, near end uses OG celeste classic speedrun tactics and recreations of the levels combined into one screen normal got 24 minutes all berries, what is gemskip and trueskip? As far as I know, gemskip means beating the beginning without touching the gem. When you do that, you have 1 dash, but the game is still possible. yeah, i found out, and I'm stuck around 1300, and struggle on 500, though i have beaten 500 some of these levels are a pain, but all of them are possible. You can find a walkthrough on youtube if you can't figure out how to beat a level. I've beaten this game on the normal difficulty in 9 minutes 42 seconds with all berries and I still couldn't beat the game with gemskip, so don't worry if you're stuck too. Awesome mod I beat it with all berries and then tried gemskip but only got so far you can hyper dash like in the original game just dash+jump while still being on the ground while before jumping</TEXT>

Original game by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Learning the new mechanics was honestly really fun. I just wish there was a harder path I could take... i think i did pretty okay good game (Finally a break from foreverred 100% trueskip Awesome Celeste Classic mod. (Well, except for Inside the Box, that level was really annoying.) To prove that people can suck at this game too, here's my final score with a whopping 297 deaths after just over an hour. Loved the escape sequence, super well done! I uploaded a video of a later playthrough to Youtube . Now you can see how much I've improved and also how to beat Inside the Box without using speedrunning tactics, since the lack of a guide was really bugging me. Again, great game. finished it very fun gimmicks (my computer reloaded so the time and deaths wasn't my first attempt) hell yes first time beating this it felt so smooth not the best but smooth very nice mod Great mod! The new mechanics were really fun! I think it's really funny how the exploding crates can crush you but their explosions can't kill you. All berries was really fun! (It really was nice to take a break from foreverred gemskip lol) this is amazing, so many new mechanics, cool music and style, i think it's smoother aswell? I did sorta bad but this is really cool gud job re: the smoothing, we changed the physics code to remove an off-by-one error in the vanilla game that causes the 'jankiness' of the movement; however, that normally completely screws up how the game plays. Meep actually wrote a genetic algorithm to find the closest possible physics values to the old code while retaining the smoothness, and it turned out nearly perfect. most of the speedrun tricks and setups from vanilla still work too! What a great and difficult mod, wish there were more mods like this! (how many strawberrys were there?) <3 there's six berries total, so you only missed one! What a journey Cut down the time :D NICE MOD! Its awesome! I love the music a ton. Is there a soundcloud page or some other place I can find it? The ost is on youtube now, if you're still interested! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrSGPfSt2PxIldACZB4tQjUGdFzw61rI I nearly gave up on âinside the boxâ (it took a while to figure out what exactly I was expected to do) but Iâm glad I didnât â that ending sequence was really fun! how do you do that puzzle? great question, neither do i. I figured it out after about twenty minutes. You need to get the second box of dynamite in the lava and get the box on top of that, so it can launch the box on top of the third box of dynamite, which you can stand on to reach the exit. To do that: go up front and push the first box of dynamite into the lava (don't dash - that will put it too far, just get it to the right edge of the lava pool). Then once it's in, quickly trigger it, go to the right, and dash into the box to push it left. This is the hard part. You have to get the jump just right so you don't overshoot the box or accidentally push it into the right wall or fall into the lava. Ideally the dynamite explodes when the box is to its left, which propels the box past the lava and into the hole so it falls next to the second box of dynamite. It's tricky though and takes quite a few tries to do for me. The puzzle after that is much easier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>PLAY THE REMAKE HERE: https://taco360.itch.io/foreverred Everred is a mod of Celeste Classic that adds completely new levels, themes, and even a few features. There's also music remixes and new sprites. You should play the original game before playing this! There's three routes through the game (Normal, Gemskip, and Trueskip) that you can take depending on which chests you open; however, the Gemskip and Trueskip routes require speedrun strats that aren't taught here. Lots of credit to Maddy and Noel from EXOK Games for the original game, and special thanks to the Celeste Classic Discord for all the help and feedback. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. ...strange. I thought it would be more difficult. Seems that the entirety of Etherealization is exclusive to Foreverred, making this game's Trueskip easier. But, for some reason... it felt harder. I struggled more on the original versions of stages I thought I had mastered, and it was always because of spike jumps. Perhaps the physics are different, or I'm just losing my skill, but it's most likely the former. Now, with both Trueskips conquered... I haven't much left in the realm of Celeste Classic. Sure, deathless Trueskip is available, but that would be too far of a step above what I'm at now. Perhaps now is the time to purchase actual Celeste on Steam so I can get mods for it. You are correct, the physics were tweaked in Foreverred to make the required tech for Trueskip more consistent. A lot of spikejumps in this version can randomly kill you if your position is misaligned. Fixing this let me get away with much more challenging level design in the remake! That would explain why the normal Celeste Classic felt so weird to play after doing Foreverred Trueskip. I definitely prefer the consistency of Foreverred, especially since it allows for even more difficult levels. Though, with the exclusion of Etherealization, it becomes that both Trueskips are technically easier than Gemskip in base Celeste Classic. Also, I did end up buying the full Celeste on Steam. Apparently, the Farewell chapter is only considered "red intermediate" difficulty, so I have a long way to go. 800 seems impossible to me, like actually I need help is there a trick to it? after this I am downloading real celeste and using this to practice for farewell Playing original Celeste Classic, I thought the base was impossible because red is one dash in Classic I can't get past 900m normal lol send help I have a 5:08 best rn This is so much harder than either Celeste Classic or Foreverred. Check both of these out too if you find this game first! yeah, foreverred smoothed out a lot of the rough difficulty spikes from the original version maybe even better than normal Is this even possible on trueskip? It's possible, but it requires a lot of advanced speedtech (spikeclips etc). Wasn't made with casual players in mind, haha. Would recommend checking out the Celeste Classic Glossary if you're interested in learning more: https://celesteclassic.github.io/glossary/ So THAT'S why I can walljump off spikes with the right timing. spikejumps tons easier here than in forevvered, but spike hitboxes are a lot more painful to dodge around. Really nice game, but the levels get so hard afterwards, if possible can you post a playthrough of your game? Good Work! though I completed the game, it was nice and hard I like it and the colors as well Good Work! Has anyone ever speedran everred? N o N e ð Incredible Game, love it! Really challenging and fun! Nice game, i like the new art style. Same errors. 9/10</TEXT>

Really, it's great. Best time so far is 3:44.61 with 10 deaths. I just wish there was a quick restart (game, not level) in the options. Whenever I finish a run I have to reset the page to try again. 3:44 with 10 deaths is really good. Thank you for playing! I agree that making people reload the page is not an elegant solution. It's a good tip for my next games! Thanks! Very nice game! My favorite genre. Thank you! Yeah, I need more platformers to come out soon. Hopefully I'll have time to play Silksong lol All the puzzles in here are INCREDIBLY well designed, with an assumption and an "aha!" moment. Very well done! quality work , really well done Dev here! Thank you for your support! I'm glad you enjoyed my game. The jumping needs to be way too precise to be fun. Dev here! Thanks for your feedback, it means a lot! I wholeheartedly agree that the jumping can be a little precise, especially for the first few levels. I constrained myself to 16x16 tiles, which means the player's jump height can't be too high if I want to make long levels, which means I can't allow a large timing window to jumps. Most jumps are a little precise because of this. I think the levels themselves can also be a little difficult. I was only able to get three play testers on board, and two of them played the easier levels after they'd already had some experience with the game. I tried to make the first and second levels as forgiving as possible, but I wasn't really able to get a good gauge on how easy the first few levels were for new players. I'll find a couple new players and ask them whether they thought the first few levels were too hard, and make changes accordingly. I'll also use what I learned for my next games! Edit: Also, if you're having trouble and a jump just seems impossible, consider looking for another way to beat it! Don't be ashamed to look at the walkthrough if you get stuck. After I played it for a bit it got okay but a few levels into sticky blocks and it got hard again. Saying "it's too hard to be fun" doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game. With the cute aesthetic, I assumed incorrectly it was a simple platformer. I will try play some more later. Works on firefox now. 10/10 Dev here! Thanks for your support! How do you know if the game was 10/10 if you haven't played it yet I died 30 times on level one when using bing A valiant effort I am the current speedrun world record holder with a time of 4:56.49 Dev here! That's a great time TheDubW! Only 5 seconds to cut before you hit sachinallums's personal best of 4:51.55! Finally got the WR by a landslide with a time of 4:18.66 What a steal! ...but is it possible to go faster? 4 Deaths?! Just superb. 10/10 would recommend. Dev here! Thanks a lot for your support. You're at the top of the leaderboard as of 4/1/2021 3:59pm CST. Pat yourself on the back! Edit: pm not am Best game I have ever played, 5/5 Dev here! Thanks for your feedback! I'm glad you liked it.

<TEXT>EDIT: I now recommend the LLVM-MOS build, it both conforms to the LoROM spec and runs at full speed everywhere, unlike the vbcc build which had a couple slowdowns. For controls, swap "B" and "Y" in the emulator to keyboard buttons "C" and "X" respectively. Full demake/rewrite of pico 8 celeste in c for the super nintendo, mostly complete, because it's an a complete rewrite, it runs at 60fps with a 256x256 world as opposed to 30fps 128x128, written entirely in c. As such the physics while similar feeling, are distinctively different to the original. I think this stands as a testament that is in fact possible to write snes games in c, and have them still be performant. Being a demake some creative liberties are taken, like reinterpreting the cloud effect and making the screen shake only apply to the distant objects in the background, separated out as it's own layer. I recommend the vbcc build because it runs faster, however the Calypsi build is the one that fits the strict rules of the Jam being LoROM, I couldn't figure out how to get VBCC to output a valid LoROM file. Should probably mention that while this is written in c, it's not using PVSNesLib, instead it's using a derivative of my original pure C demo files from my experiments with wdc816cc. Known Issues and thoughts: Sometimes loading a new level isn't completed correctly and the graphics end up in a glitched state. Level 12 has the most actors with collision and suffers from slowdowns. The only two compilers supported are VBCC and Calypsi, early dev versions were built using wdc816c, but given it's strict c89 requirement and the fact that it generates code slower than both calypsi and VBCC I see little reason to re c89 the entire codebase. I tried writing a simple audio driver for the spc700 using LLVM mos, very simple demo's worked, but there are a handful of issues with the compiler that are beyond the scope of this project but I suspect that in the near future it will be possible to write the audio code in c as well. I suspect that if LLVM mos ever ends up supporting the 65816 this will be able to run at full speed without a problem. There is no compression applied to level or tilemap data whatsoever, things are just stored directly in the rom uncompressed and it still comfortably fits within the 256kb requirement, with the sa1 I'm confident the speed problems could be alleviated and the game would also be able to run at 60fps. Special thanks to svambo for testing on hardware before the deadline. Code available here https://github.com/Phillip-May/snes-homebrew/tree/master/snes-Celeste Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Nice job! My notebook os broked and my phone no help me ð Probably a stupid question but if it's having difficulties running at full speed, a common trick is to split the operations over two frames. If the original pico 8 version is also 30 FPS, do youthink if that was done in this case, it might be full speed in C? How far off is it frame wise? It's difficult to tell from playing it. It seems faster than half speed. I mean an easy solution that would help fix both the frame rate and and feel of the player physics would have been matching the originals 30fps frame rate, VBCC would be full speed basically everywhere except level 12 with as little as a 15% speedup. You can test overclock of the cpu in Mesen in scan lines and just divide by 525 for a percentage. Adding about 50 scanlines was enough to fix most slowdowns, though 80 was basically all. There where roms, where are they? My bad, when I did the hotfix 4 hours ago they got set to hidden, has been rectified and you can see the upload time as proof no further edits where made Looks awesome! Are there roms for this? My bad, should work now No worries, I just thought i had seen some earlier and was looking forward to playing it! Thanks for your hard work! Yeah, a generous discord user tested it on hardware, so I did some last minute fixes after it didn't quite work right. Awesome Work!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Arrows - Move Left Shift - Dash Z, C, or N - Jump X, V, or M - Shoot by Kris De Asis A mod of Celeste Classic by Matt Thorson and Noel Berry Celeste Classic Discord Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Very good game, I would never have imagined this crossover before, thanks(this is my second run). Yay it was so freakin awesome! also that little zero in the end is so cute ong all in all, i loved this mod. my only complain would be that i had no idea that the double jump is only able be done once after touching ground, and walls dont count. but yea this mod was awesome new time record! erm peak? is this music from megaman? Yeah, the in-game track is Storm Eagle's theme with the main melody removed. I don't recognize the title theme, though. *I've finally beat it. I FINALLY FINISHED! I THINK I BROKE MY FINGERS DOING THIS! I think I killed my fingers from this. I never played the PC Celeste, but it's probably worse. thank you this is one of the most painful experiences i've ever had i will never do it again apart from 300 not that bad, very fun mod! took me some gemskip brain power to beat that on this was such a hard mod but very fun Don't work with XboxControler Elite This took 3 hours i didn't know you could dash until 1300m, also nice game! how did you even get that far it's possible how do you dash Very nice implementation of Megaman into Celeste and also adapting the character's mechanic to Celeste's level design is wonderful Good Work! Beautiful! Clever gameplay mechanics and, above all, clever level design! Thank you for made it! wow, really cool idea. Not having played actual Celeste, I thought the game was a lot of fun. For some reason, I really sucked at dash jumping, but other than that I really enjoyed trying to solve the platforming puzzles and getting the timing down on the shooting. I think it would've been nice if there was a sound effect each time you successfully shot the boss though. Overall, really fun experience. Now more than ever, cannot unsee Megaman's normal shots as lemons. indeed This is the most creative hack of Celeste I've played. It's super cool! It also happens to be the hardest hack I've played. I assume but the difficulty is intentional, but I recommend tuning the enemies a bit, as they shoot super quickly, and the one hit kills make it super easy to die. Thanks for the feedback! Yeah, most of the enemy balance was around the player's movement speed, which was matched with the original Celeste. I can try to fiddle with the enemy timers, but in a lot of levels, the easiest route is to just hop over the enemy after they've fired. :) looking forward to this later this evening!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Its Celeste mod for pico-8 Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. dam you can take it! kind of easy tbh It's like Celeste Classic but with more spikes everywhere! you can just take the dubble dash on the start screen speedrunners intensifies Omfg you play this before playing celeste classic nonono if you play celeste 2.7 then omfg can confirm this is more harder AGAIN??? aha! I KEEP BREAKING ITT!! 3:07 13 deaths 1 berry bro... 3:12 13 deaths 1 berry. haha 3:30 20 deaths 1 berry This actually makes the game easier. With a bit of practice on this version, I can probably finish the entire game in close to 2:00-2:30. 4:47 38 deaths (first try) (I have gotten a 3;00 run on Celeste CLASSIC so this is pretty easy for me... kinda) Damn when i speedrun i get like 6 minutes 7:55 and 58 deaths and 2 berries 203 deaths, 4 berries and 20:34 8:53 and 85 deaths:O If you don't immediately press xc on the star screen, then you can get double dash at the beginning. 28 deaths and 4:01 2 detahs and 2:25 :P only 42 death and 6:45 HK Impossible mod flashbacks UR MAKIN ME RRRRRAAAAAAGEEEEEEE3EEEEE great game tho Celeste and celeste classic speedrunner here this game is not that hard now its definitly harder then celeste classic cause i did terrible and got 9:17 but at the same time that was my first run and the controls are different from what im accustomed to (my record on celeste classic is 3:03) ha! my record a year ago was 2:59 (with gemskip) I got a 2:45 (with gemskip) damn i said a year ago This game is great! took me 22 minutes! Only problem is the first winged strawberry level is near pixel-perfect. (I think, I didnt actually get it, but i had an idea of what to do) Otherwise a fun and challenging game! it's really not pixel-perfect. I got it on my 3rd run of the game I really like it Level design? Is a shit! Impossible strawberrys, and colision bugs... is a shit a shit? is a shit Your not a speedrunner. Even the worst players could figure how to do all berries in this mod. Hey mrscotty. I'm apart of the celeste classic speedrunning community. Is it okay if we can get the original cart to run on pico8? We're working on a celeste decathlon with a bunch of celeste classic mods and we're hoping to add yours to the list. its okay if you choose not to, I'm just trying to run all the celeste mods on pico8. this is great hey buy Celeste</TEXT>

So for each round, the first player (best choice of all dice) is also the last player (the last leftover die). This seems highly advantageous to the first few players of the game as they get two turns to roll. I understand the last roll is likely a low roller, but they already got the highest that round. Seems even more awkward with 2 players (A rolls 3, B rolls 2, A gets the 1 left over [then B starts with 3]). I get that it is so each person gets a chance to roll all the dice and no one has to be skipped. I guess I'll have to see when I play with more players and how fast the board fills up with 4 players. Any chance of getting an English play through video? Or perhaps a page on Board Game Geek so that rules questions could be posted? Yes! We are working on our next games now. We will launch the BGG page and the new games together. Please, be patient!</TEXT>

I would still like to make them, just waiting for the right time to do so :) Please do find the time your art is amazing! What about characters used in your demo video? The characters in the demo video are for a personal game I'm working on called "Charge Blade Hero" . It was only after I made the video that I realized that it would be confusing to see characters that's not included in the asset pack. Sorry about that. Ahh no problem! Hope your project is going well! This GREAT package is for Unity and Ferr2D but not only! If you work with another engine, eveything is available as .png files ... so, not a big problem. If you have Unity and not Ferr2D, it works well (without Ferr2D abilities but you can use last options of Unity for the same result). If you have Unity and Ferr2D: Bingo for you. Hi @CartoonCoffee, This "Hand Drawn Dungeon Tileset" is a very good job. Do you plan to add more variety of tiles (walls, platforms, doors and traps) in this asset? For Itch users (not all are working with Unity ... but I do) you could add "classical" Tileset images = I'm sure that you will have more buyers. What do you plan to release next? I know your very good work on characters and especially on animations: I am waiting for characters from you! Hey! You make a very good point about not all Itch users using Unity. To be honest I'm not very familiar with other workflows outside of Unity's Sprite Shape and Ferr2D's plugin. But I'm absolutely willing to adapt my asset to accommodate more workflows / engines if I could get some guidance on what those requirements might be. In the meantime, I will look into creating a more "classical" tileset as you've mentioned. Thanks for this suggestion. As for what I planned next for this asset. I currently have plans to add more decorations such as suits of armor, and bone piles. I also have ideas for a couple more traps. If you have any request for this set, feel free to send an email to me at hicartooncoffee@gmail.com I do want to start increasing the amount of assets I release in 2021. I've learned a lot of cool stuff about making characters and I can't wait to share it with the community. New characters are coming soon :) Thanks!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Inkwell - A hand-drawn art pack$5</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack This is a hand-drawn pack, created with a dark, moody, sketch-like style in mind. Every image is carefully hand-penciled and inked over with quality dip pens, then scanned and digitally cleaned up. This pack will be updated with more content down the line, with additional releases being a part of the same package and freely available to those who already own it. To match its visually unique style, this pack includes unusual icons you won't find in any other pack. Feel free to make requests in the comments section! Currently, the pack includes over 100 unique icons, all fitting in squares with sides of 512x pixels, 3 unique frames, designed to be used as interface elements and measuring a little over 512x512 pixels, and 2 more small misc. interface elements. See below for a complete list. Whenever an asset is added to the list below, be certain that it is a completely new image: No recolours or resizes inflate the icon count given above, and all minor variants are clearly labeled as such upfront. I am currently working on creating two cleanup versions for all assets - pure lineart, which works better for use with transparent backgrounds, and low-opacity grayscale fill, which works better for colouring or use with single-colour backgrounds. See the devlogs for details! Note: As i work on this pack, some assets have been remade to fit higher quality standards or new workflows that allow for multiple cleanup methods. However, to never remove value from this pack in case some of the older versions of the images are still useful to some buyers, a separate folder named "objects_old" is also available in the "extras" folder. Images are moved into that folder instead of being deleted whenever a better version of an image is released into the "main" folder of the asset pack. Raw scans of the drawings and an example Krita file are also included in the Extras folder. Below, you can find a free demo to download. As a part of the OpenTaxa project, we have released all assets depicting fauna and flora under free licenses, since so many species, even threatened ones, don't have any good options for representation in visual media that aren't under copyright locks. ----- By purchasing this pack, you are allowed to use it in any game or other project, commercial or non-commercial.

<TITLE>Hand drawn dungeon icon pack</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable icon pack So I noticed that there isn't a lot of free hand drawn icon packs on the internet that would fit an old map style. I did not have any realistic photoshop brushes neither a drawing tablet, so I decided to buy an A3 sheet of paper and draw a lot of different icons, then scan them and process them to get a bunch of good and realistic looking icons. And I think in the end it turned out rather nice. There are 455 unique icons (although some of them are variations of one another) made with 2 different processing styles: Realistic and Cartoony both having 2 versions: black and white (BW) and transparent, that makes 4 images per icon with 1820 images in total. All the images are 1024x1024 squares, although some of them have a lot of empty space around the icon. So, as I mentioned earlier there are two different styles and the best way to get them in your game is to get the transparent icons and tint them to the color you want. But windows explorer won't show you white icons on transparent background so it will be easier to search for icons in BW folders. Here are examples of how the same icon looks in different folders: Now, inside of each of those folders are some more folders!.. In which icons sorted by the purpose... kinda... So there are different folders: 1. elements - Mostly icons you would use as UI elements or different signs. arrows, crosses, circles, squares, etc. Contains 76 icons 2. environment - Things you would use as background on a map. Forests, mountains, mushroom fields... Contains 14 icons 3. stuff - This is probably the best folder as it has a HUGE variety of different things you could use on a dungeon map. Rocks, crystals, swords, monsters, different papers, a lot of dungeon props and even some sci-fi stuff. Contains 128 icons 4. tiled - All the tileable stuff, textures you can seamlessly repeat. Contains 11 icons 5. variants - Variations of different things, each having about 4 similar icons. Would be useful when you need a lot of the same icon, but you don`t want it to look exactly the same. Contains 216 icons So, two folders I would suggest to check out at the first place are stuff folder and variants folder. And here are some examples of the icons in different folders: ---------------------------------- ATTENTION: Unfortunately, the situation in the world has affected me as well, because of which you will have problems with transactions to me on PayPal (this was my payout method in itch.io). HOWEVER, I thought "why should my work go to waste?" and decided to make all of my content COMPLETELY FREE! If you still want to support me you can gift me something on steam , I will be grateful for any support! :) ---------------------------------- All the icons are free, but if you want to support me and the content I make, you can donate to this project and as a thank you, you will receive some additional content if you donate $2.50 or more. Processed PSD file - Photoshop file with all the processed icons compiled to one sheet they were originally sliced up from Raw scans - 3 .bmp images with icons in their rawest form... Icon processing guide - 13-page long pdf file explaining step by step process of processing icons so you can make your own icons the way I did. You can download zip archive with all the files or you can download the pdf guide separately. It's CC0 ! You can use the icons however you want, credit is really appreciated but not required. As for the supporter content, it's pretty much royalty free, so you can use it for any of your needs too. Q: Am I allowed to modify the assets? A: Yes, edit them all however you want Q: Can I share the assets on other platforms? A: Yes, although I would be really glad if you shared a link to this page as it contains all the information about the assets Q: Will there be any updates to THIS asset pack? A: Maybe some minor will, but do not expect constant updates of the asset pack. Q; What's this Icon processing guide? A: If you want to know how exactly I made these assets and repeat the process, this guide will tell you what buttons to press in Photoshop and general idea of how to turn scanned papers in to this kind of assets. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. These are so cool! Would love enough assets to make a game in this style. You should add the license into metadata for the asset pack(s): "Edit asset pack->Metadata->Release Info->License for assets" It will increase the size of audience that will be able to find your art This is an amazing set of icons! Thanks a lot. wow what a huge and cute art pack! Paypal is not accepting payments when I try to order. It says "The merchant isnât able to accept PayPal payments at this time. Please try again later or return to the merchant and choose another way to pay." If you have an alternative method I can send payment. Thank you for notifying me. Yes, it seems that I have some trouble getting PayPal payments , so I decideed to giveaway the supporter items for free. After all, why should it go to waste? Also, I made an update on the page about it. If you still wish to support me, you can do it here if you want to.</TEXT>

There is no Joker in the package. These cards look nice! I read that I can use this asset pack in both commerical and non commercial projects, but you also said I should not redistribute it. I'm making a WebApp to play with cards and I'm looking for different skins to implement, this project is open-source and free to use and reuse under GNU GPL v3.0 so I'm asking directly to you is it fine if I include your asset pack as a customizable option of the game's cards? I'll be putting credits about you and your asset pack in the documentation and in the dedicated section of the settings of course. Yes of course you can use them! The redistribution refers to reselling the cards somewhere else (for example: making a new itch posting with the same cards). Also thank you for the nice words! Thanks for contributing to this project. If you want to try it, here is the link: https://lucambr0.github.io/DeckSpace/ It works best on Android devices, where you can install it as a webapp. If you are interested in how it works, here is the documentation: https://github.com/lucAmbr0/DeckSpace, you can check the credits in "About" inside the app or in the documentation</TEXT>

<TITLE>Ironlands Hand-Drawn Map</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable map Welcome to my hand-drawn map of the Ironlands in the style of Tolkien! Every line was drawn using a photo/paint editor. There is very little copy-paste and no map brushes were used! I have since made brushes from it and hope to make some variations of the map which could be used for different campaigns. The PDF has two versions, with and without region labels, in case you don't want the text clutter! Both include a compass rose and scale in the bottom corners. The PNG formatted color version (digital watercolor style) is designed for online use or print. It's edge to edge color, letter-sized (8,.5x11 inches) @ 300 dpi. There is a half-inch between the edge and the map labels so they shouldn't get cut off if your printer doesn't do edge-to-edge printing. I've left the region names off for a cleaner look. Map based on and designed for the Ironsworn tabletop rpg by Shawn Tomkin, and is shared under the same license ( Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license ). Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. this is so cool - thank you so much for sharing! Hi. Nice work. Thanks for providing this. I use this for a civ-like tabletop game. Is this done thru Wonderdraft? Thank you, I actually, literally drew it by hand (digitally) using Affinity Photo. There are a few trees and hills that I copied and pasted tho. I have since created brushes from the various elements so I could do another map if I ever wanted, and do it faster that way. :) Hi, this is lovely! Any chance of a high-res image file that can be used on a VTT or digital whiteboard, for online co-op play / streaming? Thank you! The PDF was saved at 300 dpi. You should be able to use your PDF reader to export the page you want at that resolution, which makes the file 2550 x 3300 resolution. I recommend using png format so that there's no compression artifacts. That should be suitable for your purposes, but I have no experience with VTTs.</TEXT>

Gracias tambiÃ©n a todos los que me habÃ©is apoyado en las votaciones populares, a los que habÃ©is donado ( me ayudÃ¡is mucho a invertir mas tiempo en esto ) y a todos los que habÃ©is descargado el juego que espero lo estÃ©is disfrutando, PodÃ©is ver los resultados oficiales completos en : Resultados oficiales ZX Game Maker DEV - READY AND PLAY Resultados ZX Game Maker DEV - SPECTRUM AND RETRONEWS Hace mucho tiempo en un lejano mundo de fantasÃ­a, vivÃ­a un valiente gato llamado Niko. Niko era conocido en la regiÃ³n por su poder, ya que tenia la habilidad de lanzar un orbe mÃ¡gico que heredo de su abuelo. Cuenta la leyenda que el heroico antepasado se enfrento al tirano hechicero que gobernaba la regiÃ³n por aquel entonces, consiguiÃ³ derrotar al malvado felino, pero en el enfrentamiento el orbe mÃ¡gico se divido en dos, el hechicero se esfumo derrotado mas antes de marchar consiguiÃ³ llevarse consigo uno de los dos orbes, esto le dio el poder de perpetuar su magia en la sombra ya que, aunque derrotado, con el poco poder que le quedaba sumado al orbe logro crear unas estatuas y almacenar su poder en ellas para asÃ­ pacientemente acumular energÃ­a y volver. Niko vivÃ­a tranquilamente en su aldea, esto cambiaria drÃ¡sticamente cuando todos los seres de la regiÃ³n le persiguen para intentar robarle el orbe, âÂ¿pero que ocurre?â se preguntÃ³ Niko, descubriÃ³ un antiguo pergamino en un baÃºl de su abuelo que revela la existencia del segundo orbe y habla de un hechizo que el malvado tirano pronuncio antes de irse por el cual, a su vuelta, todos los seres de la regiÃ³n quedarÃ­an hechizados bajo sus ordenes sin poder negarse, con la misiÃ³n de encontrar a nuestro hÃ©roe y arrebatarle su mitad del orbe, para asÃ­ tener todo su poder, ese dÃ­a ha llegado. Ayuda a Niko a encontrar las estatuas que custodian las llaves que abren las puertas de un oscuro laberinto en cuyas profundidades se encuentra la entrada al templo del hechicero donde escondiÃ³ el orbe y asÃ­ acabar con la maldiciÃ³n que pesa sobre la regiÃ³n e impedir la vuelta del malvado gato hechicero. Niko debe destruir los ojos de cristal de las estatuas y las proyecciones mÃ¡gicas con las que le atacan para asÃ­ acceder a las llaves que custodian, encontrar la entrada secreta al templo y restaurar el orbe original. Â¿SerÃ¡ Niko capaz de traer la paz a su mundo? … 1. Conectar la salida EAR del SPECTRUM con la salida EAR del cassette. 2. Rebobinar la cinta hasta el principio. 3.

I'm really glad you enjoyed the game, and I truly appreciate the review and your support. Thanks again for everything, kind regards. Hola, muy buenas: Me encanta tu juego (la historia, la mÃºsica, los grÃ¡ficos, ...) y, con tu permiso, me gustarÃ­a poder incluirlo en las compilaciones de juegos que hago para los ZX +3. Â¡Felicidades, un gran trabajo! Gracias!!!, muchas gracias merlinkv, me alegra mucho que te guste tanto y quieras incluirlo en tus compilaciones. Por supuesto tienes mi permiso no te preocupes, muchas gracias por todo, un saludo ðð Perfecto. Muchas gracias a ti por tu esfuerzo y dedicaciÃ³n. Hello!! Sorry for the intrusion, hehehe. My name is Felipe, and until recently, I have been editing games for the Spectrum on cassette. Due to personal and work reasons, Iâm going to stop editing, and I'm saying goodbye with a compilation of homebrew games for The Spectrum on USB. I want it to be the best and most complete compilation of homebrew games that has ever been made. It will be a non-profit edition, just to provide users of The Spectrum with a pack to spend hours and hours in front of their ZX. Iâve seen some of your games on http://Itch.io and wanted to ask if you would be interested in contributing any of your ZX games to this compilation. I already have legendary creators from the scene on board, but Iâd also like to reach out to you. It can be one game, two, or as many as you want, in .TAP format. Even simply granting me permission and letting me know which games I could include would be enough, and I can download them from http://Itch.io . We have created a system where the games will be encrypted, and no one will be able to use them digitally; they will only be playable on their The Spectrum, Divide, or computer. My email is playonretro@gmail.com. Best regards, and thank you very much Hello, Iâm very happy and truly grateful that youâve taken note of my games and want to include them in your compilation. Of course, you have my permission to include them. Thank you for your hard work, and all the best! ðð really thanks a lo!!!! we will play to all games and select which go well with the systems selected. you are really kind!!! THANKS A LOT!!!!! :) Hello there! How are you doing? Apologies for the delay, but launching a campaign is incredibly complex and consumes a lot of time very quickly. On Sunday, I opened pre-orders for the pendrive we discussed. I wanted to thank you again for your trust in this mini-project. The pendrive pre-order campaign has officially begun. We've worked incredibly hard to create a carousel menu, with game descriptions for all titles available in Spanish, English, and Portuguese. The price is super tight (many have said it should be higher, even asking if we made a mistake, but our intention isn't to make a profit, but rather to bid farewell to 8-bit tape editions with this pack). The final product promises to be quite good: a metal box, foam insert, a 12-page booklet, a custom-designed pendrive, and a plastic seal. The idea is that users with more modern systems can play your games and those from other creators very easily, inclusively, and directly, all at the price of a pendrive. You can pre-order here: https://forms.gle/Z42aMYeTzvoLe1PN6 And here's the game list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0FRzb8Wgy-yyX5LkY2IPRnLBLrp7MQ... We've spent months testing all the games and had to exclude a few due to technical issues, but the vast majority are included. If you place your pre-order, please identify yourself, and I'll have a little something extra for you as a token of my gratitude for your trust and generosity. You can email me at playonretro@gmail.com, and we can continue our communication there. I can send you much more information in this way. It would help a lot if you could give this pack some visibility. You can also place an order through the banner on www.playonretro.com. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! Me encanta, este juego tiene mucha esencia aÃ±os 80-90, Alex kidd, Sonic,... muy atractivo y sobre todo muy ameno de jugar, llevo un buen rato dÃ¡ndole y se me ha pasado el tiempo volando (volverÃ© a Ã©l a ver si me lo consigo pasar).

I get the cat in the loading screen but after that a currupt screen with green border and black, green stripes. Hello nikosidis, the game is tested on real hardware (+2 and +2a) and works well, as an example on the YouTube channel "Sinc Lair" Thank you for the reply. I use DivIDE and the 128K version. I could always try to use tape but it is so slow :) Most games work with DivIDE. Is it possible to buy the cassette? Hello again, if you are referring to the physical cassette of the game, there are no physical editions for sale, sorry. Regarding the problem, I have read that there are certain incompatibilities with some games when using DivIDE, unfortunately I do not have any DivIDE or DivMMC unit to test it. I'm very sorry I can't give you a good solution, tell me if you finally found a way to solve it, greetings ;) Great news :D I installed esxdos instead of fatWare and now the game loads :D Looking forward to play the game. Great!!!, I was worried about this not working in DivIDE, I am very happy that you have given a solution and I will include the solution as soon as I can in the game manual for DivIDE users, for my part I thank you for share it and I really hope that you enjoy the game a lot, thank you very much for your patience and your interest, greetings ;) Ante todo felicidades por tus logros, los mereces. Es un gran juego.

Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Wow this game looks soo much different than when I played it in GMTK After DeadLine , its good to see your working on it still. I played it for a bit and great job with the tutorial area, I see you have removed the zipline mechanics which was fun but a little buggy as well (maybe that's why you removed it). I enjoyed the big rock is further back now but its much harder to progress in the game now with spikes everywhere and the box guy. Hey thank you so much for playing :D Yeah I had to make some adjustments until now. I think I kind of incorporated the "normal" difficulty with the tutorial, as I did not make the next chapters yet, so I had the impulse to create the "normal" maps already :D But I will try to make the tutorial area easy to do and then gradually increase difficulty. (that's going to be the next step) And then I'll try to finish the game. hi, your game look super neet but when i run it i can't move, help. hmm, that's strange. Are you using WASD for movement? yeah Did you not press the 'Play' button underneath the list of controls before you started trying to move? Because that's the mistake I made!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Niko and the Cubic Curse - Jaxx's Quest Tech Demo</TITLE>
<TEXT>Niko and the Cubic Curse - Jaxx's Quest is a cancelled sequel/spin off/DLC for Niko and the Cubic Curse . This game would have been focused on telling more of Jaxx's story that was cut from the final game. The gameplay would have been more metroidvania styled than the base game. This demo is very short, and should only take a few minutes to see all of the content that was developed. Once you hit a checkered wall, that is where the level ends. Also some mechanics were never implemented. (Enemies don't deal damage, and jumping off the edge does not respawn the player. Only fix is restarting the level.) FAQ When did the project begin development? This game entered development shortly after the release of Niko and the Cubic Curse in September 2021. This was originally taking cut gameplay mechanics from Niko and adding it together to work as a metroidvania. I was always quite happy with the result I got while working on this project, and decided it was a good opportunity to tell a cut story from the base game. How long was the project in development for? Maybe a month. I returned to the project for a short period in early 2022, but quickly decided to leave the project as is. Why was it cancelled? A lot of reasons. The biggest one was simply because I wanted to make RPGs instead of platformers. This was only one of the projects I was working on at the time, and I opted to cancel this project to focus effort into other projects I liked more. Another reason was the poor sales of Niko. I did not feel like a DLC expansion for Niko was something people wanted, which lead to the idea of possibly releasing this as sequel/spin off. After putting more thought into it, I decided that I wanted to instead put my passion into a new project that people might like more. There was a period of time that I considered returning to make the DLC when Niko was being brought to Nintendo Switch, but I once again decided my time was better spent developing something new. Why release now? For a while, I thought there was a chance I would return to the project. However, two years later, I am deep into developing a very large scaled game. I do not see myself returning to this DLC, so I decided it would be fun to at least release the tech demo online for archival purposes. Is there any chance this project gets un-cancelled? Maybe a 2% chance. I think I would like to make a metroidvania one day, but if I do, it would likely not be related to Niko and the Cubic Curse. Was there any other cancelled Niko projects? Yes (kinda). I was planning for Niko to get a free co-op update on all platforms. Long story short, I found the multiplayer to not be very fun, so the update never got finished. Are there any future plans for Niko? Currently, no, but I have had an idea in the back of my head for a while. Niko was my first real game. It has a lot of issues that bother me a lot looking back at the project. The final game is quite different from my original plan for the game, and I wish more of my original ideas made it to the final game, both in terms of gameplay and story. With where my development skills have come in the last 2 years, I think I could now make the game I initially envisioned. If I return to Niko, it would be to remake Cubic Curse into the game I wanted it to be. However, I am still not convinced Niko has a market that would make a remake worth it. Also, work on the new game is taking up all of my free time as it is. But maybe one day, I will return to the idea of a remake.

This game was originally created for "Marcos Game Dev Jam 3" in 2 days, in this JAM the theme was "Physics" so I wanted to do something fun and chaotic! Nikola's Fate came in 14th place standing out more in "Game Experience". :D Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. ParabÃ©ns pelo jogo! Ã divertido de controlar e atirar, Ã© muito bom coletar moedas e ver seus recursos evoluindo. Eu adoraria que tivesse uma forma de fechar a loja, pois quando vocÃª compra algo ainda precisa esperar muito tempo atÃ© que a loja se feche, e isso fica entediante de forma que vocÃª passa a temer a loja. Isso melhoraria muito o jogo :) MarcÃ£o! Que honra vÃª-lo por aqui, e fico muito feliz que vocÃª tenha gostado do jogo, muito obrigado, de verdade! :D Estarei fazendo um update muito em breve no jogo que vai consertar isso e outras coisas. :) Mais uma vez, muito obrigado! Grande abraÃ§o!</TEXT>

But the tranquility of his castle is disrupted when Frankenstein, driven mad by an impossible love, kidnaps his beloved Lunara and locks her deep within his fortress. Now, Nikolav must travel through haunted forests, cursed swamps, and ancient catacombs, facing all kinds of creatures: Zombie Frogs, Werewolves, Mummies, and many other enemies lurking in the shadows. Only his cunning, agility, and vampiric powers can help him overcome each level and rescue his love before it's too late. Can you guide Nikolav on his adventure through the eternal night and defeat the fearsome Frankenstein?

Gfx is its strong point but game play wise there is a lot of room for improvement. Hit detection needs tightening, graphical glitch on the big wolf screen, and the game design feels very basic. Hopefully all of these can be improved before release. Looks fantastic, great design...go ahead Hey, I hope you don't mind, but I have put your awesome game in this months best homebrew games video. A good looking demo, a great game coming up. I've also included it in my new video along with other recently released games. Hope you like it. I'm absolutly ready for more! This "Demo" has potentional! Keep it coming, guys! Funny little game :D And very detailed sprites :o excelente trabajo! Felicitaciones a todo el equipo! Pues felicidades por el 2do. lugar en la Flash Party, el juego estÃ¡ excelente, el estilo grÃ¡fico muy trabajado con ese contraste entre el violeta y el azul que quedÃ³ genial y unos sprites super trabajados y hermosos de AdriÃ¡n y por supesto programado perfectamente por Juan en Assembler.

Que mas !!! ð Looking forward to the finished game. No idea why the player isnât visible in the bottom room - I played it on the C64 core of Mega65 (which was ported from MiSTer). Where there's a bug, there's a lazy programmer! ð We'll take this into account and fix it for the full release. Thanks for reporting it! More like a lazy Viper. Sorry, your original demo works perfectly fine. I downloaded the very first "crack" from CSDB, which introduced this bug. Congratulations on this demo version! It's very enjoyable and has a great look and feel. The game presents a very appealing challenge that is not at all easy. Looking forward to the full version to take it on! Thanks!!! We'll have news about the full game coming soon! ð§ââï¸ ComprarÃ© la version completa...se ve muy chulo... Estamos trabajando en ello ! Gracias! Very nice game! Thanks Saberman! Nice gameplay!

Iâm planning on use it to make an RPG with a deep back story so: Do you think you could add expressions or at least a static sprite facing forward or standing still? Maybe as a paid add-on pack? I love these heroes! Do you think you might ever add any forward facing versions of the combat sprites? Not even necessarily animated versions, just like something to use in dialogue? I'd love to buy and use this pack, but I need something with forward facing bust images for dialogue. Love the girl with the hat!!! She looks like she may or may not have an obsession with explosions :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>90's_Kanji/Word_Trainer_jrpg_Word/Sentence_Miner</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows ! ! 90's Kanji&Battle Sim Readme ! ! Welcome to my simple retro-looking rpg / jrpg inspired app/game, to help make it more fun to rep. Kanji and Vocab in Japanese. Functions : push F1 , to bring up the word creation menu. Here you can add new words for yourself. the order is , kanji/word - kanji reading Kanji meaning - Wrong alternative 1 Wrong alternative 2 - Wrong alternative 3 then theres a save word bubble down in the right bottom corner. When you add a new word the words will be saved to a .JSON list in your user erea on your PC. If you want to record or find audio in the .mp3 format you can manually put them in you APPDATA folder for the game. mine is : C:\Users\l1l1n\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\FF9_Kanji_Battle\audio\kanji_words But yours may differ. Just search around for it. REMEMBER ! That the filename for the audio must match the kanji/word directly . Like ä¸ must be ä¸.mp3 . Press F5 to restart the BGM ( Background Music ) !! PLEASE !! : Unzip the FF9_Kanji_Battle.zip into your ' C:\Users\Your_User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata ' If you dont have a Godot folder there just make one. The final tree should look like this : C:\Users\Your_User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\FF9_Kanji_Battle It's inside the : C:\Users\l1l1n\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\FF9_Kanji_Battle\audio\kanji_words You'll add in your own audio files for your new words/kanji/whatever you add : ) NEW! : Now you can also add in your very own .png pictures . Just make a "images" folder in ' C:\Users\lYOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\FF9_Kanji_Battle ' Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Now free : ) It can also be used for other languages, or even other things you wanna quiz yourself on. Like an srs with simple turn based battle : ) And also, after adding a new word/kanji + audio , you've got to exit the game after it autosaves (20 sec) , then open it again and your new words and audio will be in there for you to battle : ) I've found out that it's very important to have a constant bitrate for the audio files when you add them manually, or else it won't play in the game. You can edit and then re-export the pronunciation in Audacity for example and be sure to select constant bitrate : ) You need to go into " C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\FF9_Kanji_Battle " and add some words, or else the game starts with game over for some reason. lol .. [ { "distractors": [ "line", "ground", "stick" ], "kanji": "ä¸", "meaning": "one", "reading": "ãã¡" }, ] Then save it in there, as words.json I'm having some trouble getting the manually added audio to play every time. But I will find the issue eventually.. : (</TEXT>

It's the only one I've heard that truly captures the true nostalgia of the era, both in melody and tonality. Massive congrats to you, and thank you so much for offering it. I will be using this pack for my in-development pixel art jrpg %100. Thank you so much for your amazing feedback! Your words are truly inspiring and remind me why I love creating music. Iâm glad my work resonated with you and will be part of your pixel art JRPG. I checked out your page, and your game looks fantastic! Best of luck with your project! ð®ð¶ P.S. Donât hesitate to reach out if you need anything via email, DM, or comment. The project on my page is actually a game from several years ago. The one that this music will be in is called "Seed of Nostalgia". And it's much more influenced by the mana series and chrono trigger, in it's art direction. I'm hoping to have it posted to itch by the end of next week with the first alpha demo. Steam page will be up then as well. I know to achieve results this polished and authentic takes time, but if you make more packs, I will buy them <3 Iâm really looking forward to Seed of Nostalgia, and if you donât mind, Iâd be happy to share it across my socials. Also, just a heads up: this music pack will be getting new updates soon, and all of them will be free for anyone who has already purchased it. Thanks again for your support, and good luck with your release! ^^ I would love a share :D About the pack getting updates that is super awesome news! I will keep on the lookout for that! Here is a super short video of your music in my game's battle sequences :D Wow, it looks super cool! Iâm so happy to see my music in action xD Posted it on my X page! Gorgeous! any plans releasing it under 16bit fx ? Hey, thank you! Yes, Iâm planning to create a 16-bit version of this pack, as well as a brand-new 16-bit Era pack.

<TITLE>One Summer Night - JRPG Soundtrack</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable soundtrack Every thirty years, on a single summer night, the God of Darkness stirs from its slumber. To keep the world safe, the faithful perform a sacred pilgrimage: the Solar Priests and their guardians travel across the land, gathering primordial energy from ancient shrines. When the god awakens, the offering is made, and peace is restored. It is said that if this ritual is not performed, the world will forever be engulfed in darkness, ending life as we know it. But for the people, a few days before, it is a night of celebration, as it's The Festival of Nightfall . Lanterns are lit, prayers are sung, and the chosen priests are sent off as saviors who will return in glory. This cycle has endured for centuries. On this cycleâs eve, an outsider named Ren is mysteriously pulled into the world. Lost and confused, he is swept into the pilgrimage of Selia , one of many Solar Priests, and her loyal guardians, Kaelen and Mira looking to harvest primordial energy from temples all around the world . Against all tradition, Ren vows to protect Selia and see her safely through her fate. Shadowing their journey is Eryndor , a brilliant and beloved high priest. To the crowds he is inspiring, larger-than-life, adored as a chosen leader. But in secret, he seeks to shatter the cycle not with sacrifice, but by claiming the power of the God of Darkness, which to him is the only way to end the cycle and protect the world forever if he's able to control that power. He hunts down other pilgrim groups, harvesting their primordial energy, and dreams of absorbing the God of Darkness itself to become the âtrue savior.â When the pilgrimage nears its end, the truth of the sacrifice that is the cost to pay to finish the ritual is revealed to the group. Selia and her friends, once faithful, are shaken to their core. On the following fated night, Eryndor unleashes his ambition, fusing with the god and twisting into a monstrous demigod bent on remaking the world in his image. In this moment of despair, love becomes the light. Ren, bound to Selia by their shared love, awakens Helios , the long-dormant God of Light, shaped by the love for Selia and the world he got to know. By embracing the primordial energy through love rather than ambition, he becomes Selia's conduit for primordial energy and a weapon capable of ending the cycle of darkness once and for all. The final battle is fought between Light and Darkness , between Ren-Helios and the twisted Eryndor. At dawn, the cycle is broken. The God of Darkness is destroyed. Selia and her guardians live. But on that faithful one summer night , Ren is gone, fading with the sunrise, his sacrifice ensuring that the world and his beloved will never again fear the endless night. https://soundcloud.com/indiekev-official/sets/one-summer-night-ost-jam-08?si=522... So coming in here I had a vague idea that I really wanted to do a JRPG, and I wanted to go from Studio One into learning to actually write music in Dorico. I am a SUCKER for most of them, as well as Souls Games. So I guess I wanted to do a mix in a way. I already had the main motif in my head while in total silence in the car. This is what you mainly can hear on the title theme. What I tried to do is make that track barebones so I could later do a track that's missing here unfortunately, but I also wanted to make sure I'd use it as a leitmotiv, but trying hard no to make it TOO obvious. After the title theme I started to work on the battle theme. This was easy enough to start off, as what's currently at the end of the track was the first section I wrote. I did have a bit of a harder time getting into the middle sections but stumbled upon some things I liked and developed both ideas as I went. And one thing I tried to do was to make sure was that it wasn't too overly serious, feel like it could work on most environments, and also add a bit of whimsical. The track is supposed to just loop, but with time lacking and Dorico seemingly crashing every 5 minutes as well as NotePerformer, I just ended it abruptly but you get the gist. Now the 3rd track is where the headaches began.... I had an idea that I wanted the earlier battle theme but with choirs, organ and other epic instruments, but one try wasn't conclusive, it just didn't work for some reason. So I decided to start from scratch and I had the start of the track kind of formed. Even though I say that, there were MANY iterations that didn't look or sound like much. I wanted somethiong very regal and dramatic for the first parts of the track, it took A LOT of time to figure out where I was headed, until at some point everything started fitting more seemlessly. At first I wanted to have multiple phases for that final showdown against Eryndor, but I had so many issues that week that it seemed like it would not be feasible, so somewhere along the line, I just started considering the track more and more like a Meydley, each section being kind of their own team and moment in battle, the hard thing was to fit them seemlessly. There are some notable passages for me, so here's a breakdown: The initial section is the God of Darkness awakening, plain and simple. Organ is really loud, choir is omnipresent, it has all the marks of an omen coming to pass. I wanted the very slow ending to the section as a way to really hammer what the group has in front of them. And that's also the section where Eryndor attempts to control the God of Darkness, being just a little bit early to the party. It feels regal and godlike, Eryndor is starting to ascend after having absorbed the God of Darkness power, but in the end ends up being the one losing himself to madness. I think it works especially with the super dissonant organ finish with the Tenor singing alone, it felt like it was Eryndor lost his soul to the God of Darkness. Of course the Organ will the main characteristic of Eryndor in his ascension, but slowly something else will take its place when he's lost to the darkness. This is a long drawn out couple of sections, stretching pretty much 3 sections. It's the start of the combat with Eryndor as a twisted godform. It's dramatic, you face casualties. We hear a solo Viola, which is pretty much the instrument of Eryndor's darkness. Some more tension and building up for section D. Here the Solo violin joins which is Ren, seeing how many of the people he's loved being lost into the darkness. It's pure despair for him, until he starts finding the resolve with Selias alone. This section made me shiver literally when I was making it, not as much the end but the start of it was haunting me for days and I'm so happy with it. Now Ren is trying is best to defeat Eryndor but to no avail, Selias is hurt in the process as well as his companions while Eryndor lays waste to the world. We hear the choir, organ, brass, strings and winds swell up as the pressure mounts. Ren decides to give his all and the real fight really begins as he's able to awaken the primordial energy as the vessel for Selias, until... We have some parts of the battle theme here with Eryndor's low growl in the background. The choirs are here to make it feel more powerful too. Ren awakens Helios godform as Selias holds him, and Eryndor cowers in disgust to the blinding light. Now both are at the same power level starts dishing out proper damage now to Eryndor, we now hear the proper battle theme in a lower darker key and it works beautifully (for me). Now this is extended here because it's where the end of the fight would loop pretty much. The end pretty much spells the end of Eryndor and the God of Darkness. Now there would be so much more I'd like to do, the kissing scene, the post final fight, some additional tracks, maybe I'll get to do it soon. This was insanely complex for me to do and at some point Dorico just completely refused to export the third track and had to record my audio output with OBS from Dorico and extract that audio to have the final file... This is pretty much the third musical project I created since I started music from scratch last year for OST Jam 07. I don't know if people will like it, but it's not often that I am proud of something I've done, but here I am. This jam was incredibly exciting, I went WAY above my skill level and I'm happy as it pushed me to try new things. I hope you guys will enjoy this as much as I enjoyed making it.

Bought the physical copy from Amazon, like what I have read a lot. It's a shame how much Amazons print on demand quality has dropped the last couple years though, lots of tilted pages and uneven cutting of the whole book, content is amazing though! Hey, glad to hear it! :D This book was very much my attempt to consolidate my thoughts on all the things I like about DnD as well as all the things I would want DnD to become. Itâs really awesome that people are enjoying it, and makes the sometimes-painful process of creation all worth it! Sorry about the POD. My copy seems ok but I guess one canât fully account for Amazon shenanigans. Cheers! Hi, the preview is not (yet?) available on DTRPG. Hi there! I was able to get the preview to work just now through drivethru's desktop site by deleting my cookies, but the site does seem a little screwy ATM. I can't even find it on mobile now. I'll upload more preview pages to itch when I get a chance! Thanks, now it's visible.</TEXT>

I just recently tried out the game I guess this is a demo. Still I sadly have some things I didn't like the game doesn't once tell you how to recover health or how, there was no way to rebind the controls, you can't boost forward and use the upward thrust at the same time, and though I know it's part of the game the boost meter runs out rather fast. Still I'd like to see where this game goes it felt abit like a slower version to DaemonXmachina to me. legit this is what i have been looking for</TEXT>

Gert Adendorff of the 1st/3rd NNC and a trooper from the Natal Carbineers, arrived at Rorke's Drift bearing news of the shocking defeat and destruction of the British Army at Isandlwana. They carried with them one other bit of information of importance to the garrison at Rorke's Drift. Part of the Zulu Impi, some 3000 to 4000 strong, was now headed directly their way. Upon hearing the news, Lt. Chard, Lt. Bromhead, and Acting Assistant Commissary James Dalton had to make a quick decision. Attempt a retreat to Helpmekaar or defend their tenuous position at the Drift. Dalton pointed out that a small column, traveling in open terrain, burdened with carts and hospital patients, would be easily overtaken and defeated by the numerically superior Zulu force. Their only chance was to stand their ground and fight...

I have a question about the design, is it doable to get all three stars in the same attempt in all the levels? Cheers, glad you're enjoying it. There was a plan to do a 'master run' achievement which was to do the stars all in one go on each level but I wanted to keep the game as a relaxing, play at your own pace platformer. In my play testing all but 'Level 15: A Tight Fit' are possible to 3 star in one go. This level needs about 30-60 seconds more because getting all the coins requires end-to-end in the level which isn't really possible with the 2 minutes par time it has currently. Thank you for the reply, on one hand I welcome that there is no master mode because I think I would be compelled to get it done, on the other, it feels like cheating going for the stars in different runs. I have 2 stars missing only, from the last level, but all in all, it is hard but rewarding and it feels doable. You could turn this into a sweet remake of Lode Runner. Uff there's a blast from the past. I think I played the C64 version back in the day - it's true, I saw the asset pack I used with the character and was trying to think what it reminded me of, it must be Lode Runner. Watched some refresher vids and it does have some interesting mechanics that could be expanded on using the platformer code I've done. We'll see ;) I'll keep hoping! This looks great! Is there any reason for me to wait for the Catalog release? Like online high scores or anything? Or am I just as well getting it here now? Hi slider, at the moment I've got no dates for anything and I'm not sure if they will give access to the network API which some games have on the Playdate Catalog. If there's demand and I can do it for both the Catalog and the itch version I would probably add a leaderboard just for fastest level completion times which makes the most sense. So the main choice is simply, if you buy on the Catalog it's part of your Playdate account and will update automatically. If you buy here you just have to sideload and update yourself when there's a new version. Such a great wee game. Small review if anyone is interested - apologies for the game music level: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3hhziU0Cv0 Wow...lovely review, thanks so much. All fair comments on the level select, it's true it could be better so you get a more global view of all the levels available and your status on each a bit more instantly. I'll add the video to this page if that's ok. Thanks again. Great game! I'm having fun with it, and it's challenging to get all the stars but fun. I want to provide some feedback: Hi Jorge. Glad you're enjoying it, and thanks for the feedback. * Tough one this, I'll have to have a think what I could that is quicker - maybe even just changing the order in the menu so that restart is first - actually not sure if I can even highlight it by default. I wanted the player to have a bit of control so it shows the level card and you decide when to start the timer - which for a no death run can be multiple clicks to just get going again, I agree. * Again, it's true - getting the setup for the moving platforms is hardest on this level compared to the rest. I wanted the movable platforms to be a bit organic and although it's hard to know, there is actually a large range for the jump to fall on to the second platform nearer to the exit. Might be worth adding another static platform so you get a second chance to go back and edit the positions on the crank * The stars are awarded in any order, you don't have to get all three in one go. You can do the coin run star first then go for the time/zero deaths. I was going to put in a 'master mode' which required getting all three stars at once but it would require way more testing of the par times. Oooh, and I was retrying all the time trying to get all 3 stars in one run on each level xD Now that I know this, I can finally replay lvl 15 just trying to get the time star :D Hehe, sorry that's not explained but I didn't want to make it too difficult so you can play levels at your own pace, get the coins first and learn the layout then go for zero deaths then fast time or whichever order you want :) As I said, I may do a master mode in an update which would switch the levels to need you to complete all stars in one go, but that needs some deep testing to make sure everything is possible with the current par times. Plus I would need to think of a reward for doing all the levels in master mode. All stars collected. Not posting the image at the end to prevent spoilers. Great game! It was really fun, one of those that makes you start cursing but retry over and over again. Woo! Glad you fully completed it, hope some of the later levels kept you on your toes for the zero death run ð Thanks for the feedback. The last level was much harder originally but even I found the challenge got to the point of not being fun, so I toned it down a bit. Good to hear people can get through it with a bit of perseverance ð This is superb! Posting a review next Wednesday (31st). Great work from the whole team. Thanks a million. Will link the video here when it's up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack This Platformer Engine is designed to be everything you need to create any platformer game. The engine has a long list of features which will be added to continuously as it is developed. The code is clean and well commented, explaining how each part of the engine works. Features (v1.0.0): Features (v1.2.0): Features (v1.3.0): Features (v1.4.0): In order to download this asset pack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $19.99 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hey I really like the look of this engine but I've got a few questions: Does this use GMS1.4 physics? Does this support tilemap collisions? Either way feels really solid! He released a statement that he wasn't supporting this any longer, but I can answer: no physics, but the code works great for movement; no tile map collisions, it uses objects, but this can be converted; it is really solid; I have been using this engine for years and it imports nicely into the new versions of gamemaker studio and can be edited and updated (as I have done). People have issue with the window size, but it can be changed, I can assure you; you just need to take a look at resolution tutorials, etc. I'm thinking of buying it. Can you please elaborate on changing the resolution as this puts me off as a beginner coder. Is it easy? Also, my sprites need to be 128x128. Is this easy enough to change? I've tried other engines where they didn't really adapt well to different mask sizes as this broke all the collision code. Thanks! Sure, but remember this isn't a boiler plate solution because you will have to tailor and tweak the code: Many GM games use a setup or "initialization" room; in this room they put objects that run code necessary to tweak some settings; a less code heavy approach would be to setup a view and room size for this room and the rest of the game tends to match those settings. What I do is use an object, placed in the setup room, that runs code in its create event: // resize game surface surface_resize(application_surface,res.w,res.h); // resize window var _w=res.w*res.s; var _h=res.h*res.s; window_set_size(_w,_h); // set video applied settings time alarm[0]=1; This code resizes the game drawing surface in order to scale the game without funky artifacts. The lines that reference res.w*res.s and res.h*res.s is just an enum that I made to contain the size of the window (width=w, height=h) which is multiplied by how much you want to scale the window (scale=s); making enums for this purpose is easy, but make sure you define the enum BEFORE this code, you can even put it right above the code that I'm currently explaining (in the create event of the object); my enum for the window size looks like this: enum res { w=352, h=224, s=4, } Width (w) is the width of the window at 352 pixels (unscaled); height (h) is the height of the window at 224 pixels (unscaled); these two numbers are multiplied by the scale (s) which is four; this results in an actual window size of 1408x896. Remember, this code is placed before the code previously mentioned (or at least called before it). window_set_size will actually set the window's new size (referencing the _w and _h variables which were used to hold the scaled window dimensions. This function won't take effect right away, which is why the next line sets an alarm in the same object; the code in the alarm event is: window_center(); // start game room_goto_next(); This code is simple: the window is centered on your computer screen and then the next room is loaded. Having an alarm delay after the window is resized and before the game progresses to the next room ensures that the window is setup and centered properly before the actual game starts. Lastly, in order for the change to be usable in-game, you have to setup a view; you can either do this in the room editor or in code; I like to do it in code because it makes me feel big and powerful. I make a camera object and either leave the sprite blank or make it invisible. In the camera object's create event I setup the view: // create view camera var _camera=camera_create_view(0,0,res.w,res.h,0,id,-1,-1,res.w/2,res.h/2); // setup view view_enabled=true; view_visible[0]=true; // set view to camera view_set_camera(0,_camera); In this code, a camera is created using the enum values that I explained previously (creating a camera this way means that you will only have to change the enum values in order for the entire system to be affected) and is stored in the _camera variable. Setting view_enabled to true enables the use of views for the current room, in which the camera is present. Setting view_visible (for view "0", which is the view to which the camera is attached) will enable the camera's view. Lastly, view_set_camera attaches the camera (which is stored in the _camera variable) to the view (in this case view "0"). Remember, with this code, the view follows the camera object only, so you have to make the camera object follow the player; you can do this easily by just setting the camera object's x and y position to the player's x and y position in the step event of the camera object; if you encounter unwanted lag or choppy movement, experiment with begin step and end step in addition to the normal step event . You can create the camera object instance in the player's create event or set the camera object to persistent and place it in the setup room (be mindful of referencing the player object before it is created; I usually just put all player referenced code in an if "player exists" type comparison to be safe). Lastly, delete your camera with camera_destroy(view_camera[0]) when changing rooms or ending the game, otherwise it will cause a memory leak which will slow your game, due to repeated test-playing, until it eventually crashes and you have to reboot your computer. Also, if you have weird position based drawing artifacts such as vanishing pixels on object sprites, in your scaled game you can round the drawing position in the drawing event of the object; this keeps the game from attempting to scale pixels when the object's position doesn't quite match up with the display position in a scaled room. This isn't a problem that everyone has. Check your GM manual for explanations of all of the functions that I have written about, this will give you insight into their various parameters (especially since I didn't give a more in-depth explanation of why I threw in random -1 parameters and such). Take this process one step at a time; this seems way more difficult than it actually is. Thank you for your detailed reply! This is super helpful. Cheers :-) You're welcome; you asked for detail lol. Hi, is there anyway u would resell [Pathfinding for Platformers] asset? Thanks you in advance Before I make this step, I would like to make some basic questions - Exported games can run on Android - Is possible to switch the charater sprite - Shop system allowing to buy items - Perk page / skills I would pay you for such features, add me to further discussion Thanks Andre me too hello Rupeck. Can you upload to itch.io the platform runner engine? Hey Rupeck! Great job on this engine, it's really one of the best! But where's your runner engine? Uploading it on itch.io as well would be great! This is amazing! Highly recommend this. You can edit this to fit your needs very easily. This engine will save you so much time and let you tweak it to fit your needs.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Platformer Hero Pack</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Update 1.3 - Added a new folder called 'guns' to each variant folder. Each variant now has additional animations for two kinds of rifle. Each has shooting, crouch-shooting and running animations. Update 1.2 - Hazmat variants added - Survivor added - Ninja added - Tactical variants added Update 1.1 Additional costumes: - Spacesuit (orange or white) with or without a helmet - Overalls (red, blue, orange, dark grey) This pack contains a set of animations for a pixel-art platformer character. All images are 56 x 37. The character himself is 11 pixels wide and 29 pixels tall when standing. The character comes in a choice of 17 costumes and 4 skin tones, each separated into folders. The animations contained are: - Standing - Crouching - Running - Jumping forward (rising, falling and landing) - Jumping in place (rising, falling and landing) - Two punch combo - Being hit - Falling backwards - Falling over/Dying - Shooting a pistol (standing) - Running with a pistol - Sword strike (standing) - Sword strike (moving) The character comes in light, medium, dark or grey skin tones and a combination of: Hats: baseball cap, balaclava, wide-brimmed hat, helmet, bandana, gasmask, space-helmet Tops: Tanktop, long sleeves, jacket, overalls Other: Elbow/knee pads, backpack Each combination has its own colour scheme. The images come in folders containing PNG sequences. A blank frame separates each animation. I have also included the .gal file, which can be opened in GraphicsGale so you can edit it further or try out other combinations, although you will have to recolour them yourself.

Thank you very much. if you for some reason dont like it anymore i would love if i can have it cause i dont have bank account Hi, the pack is free now. thank you so so much been wanted for a long time i will make game with it and you will in the credit promise why is this doesnt show at your page anymore? I bought this package from you. Thank you very much. Can I use this package for my game in Steam? Yes, you can use these sprites in your games, commercial or otherwise. Thanks for purchasing. Hello, i purhase your sprites to support you because you have nice animation of ninja character. Can you add Samurai character? Hey man. I can't promise anything for the moment since I'm very busy, but when I update it again I will definitely add some samurai assets. There appears to be a few missing frames within this set. Hi, could you elaborate? Hi, I actually think it is just the way the frameswere exported from your sprite application, the break in animation come out as blank frames. No worries :) Yeah you're right. I used blank frames to separate each animation in the strip. Thanks for clarifying. Is that possible to support jumping with shoot weapon and melee weapon? Excelent work. Your animations are so smooth and I love the amount of variations you have here. Might I suggest a rifle animation as well? I can probably jerry rig one, but nothing as good as the animations you have here. Thanks, it's appreciated. It has been quite a long time since I last worked on this pack and I didn't have plans for another update, but if you tell me what variant it is that you're using I could probably put together some rifle animations for it easily enough. ummm... all of them... lol if you want I'll pay for the extra work if it is an inconvenience to you. I'm currently using them for a PUBG2d, so the amount of variations is great. Well if it's a only a couple of animations I can probably churn them out. Exporting them into folders is the time consuming bit, but if you've got a use for them then it'll be worth it. No need for extra payment. Are you looking for a modern assault rifle, or something a bit older? just a generic rifle. And actually just for the medium skin tones of the skins. Not the other skin tones. If you have time to do both an old and a modern, I would be much obliged. I just updated the pack. I added two kinds of rifle (the second could also work as a shotgun). You might wish to adjust the timings or skip a frame to make rapid-fire look snappier. I also added crouch shooting since I figured it'd be useful. I hope you get some use out of them. Thanks for purchasing. 2763</TEXT>

<TITLE>RPM - Rage's Platformer Movement Plus$4.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack for Windows Latest Update: 11-04-20 Don't have Clickteam Fusion 2.5? Head on over to Clickteam's website! NOTE: RPM Plus REQUIRES the Fusion 2.5+ DLC! A version is available for standard Fusion 2.5 as well! RPM - Super Basic Edition (RPM v1.0) is now free! Visit the official topic on the Clickteam forums for support and more! Check out Volnaiskra's volCAMERA for an additional camera system for RPM! Check out Volnaiskra's VACCiNE 2 for an improved input system for RPM! A new general purpose FastLoop platformer movement engine designed for Clickteam Fusion 2.5! RPM includes: This movement can be used commercially, non-commercially, or for learning purposes. The only stipulations are that the engine source cannot be shared/re-sold, nor can the Angela character be used commercially without explicit permission The demonstration file contains an .EXE with 4 examples I developed to see what type of movements I create. This includes Yoshi's Island, an "Out-of-the-Box" sample, a "Greninja Gaiden" type thing (using the excellent sprites by Neweegee), and a basic Shantae example (mostly to test animation). Be sure to read the control file, there's a lot of stuff involved! All of the demonstrations run on the exact same code, using behaviors and widgets to make each character different. For legal reasons, the demonstration characters are not included in the paid packaged. They're a free download to show how the engine functions! However, you do need the engine source to actually use them, as they rely on behaviors. This works best with the Windows exporter. Special Thanks: Elvisish, NB-The-Dragon, Neweegee, Luke T., Kritter, DinnerSonic, darkFunction, Volnaiskra, Furriokun, Johnathan Verge, Aroka, Charmandrigo, Zevifa, and tons of others! Update 11-06-20 - Added "_AttributeCheck" to the Player Attributes Widget. This checks to see if the default Player Attributes was automatically changed by RPM at the start of the frame. The Player Attributes object will carry this information to the next frame due to being a global object. - Added "CeilingCheck" value to the Ledge Confirm detector. This checks for a ceiling after the player begins to climb up a ledge . If it detects one while this value is active, the mask will automatically go into a Crouching state. - Added "_MultiJumpWallSlideBuffer" to the Player Attributes Object. This value keeps multi-jump from applying when the player performs a wall jump, allowing them to retain any remaining multi-jumps afterwards. -Grabbing a ledge will now reset MultiJump back to 0. -Fixed an issue where Aerial Crouch was still active if you grabbed a ledge. Update 10-16-20 - Added support for Volnaiskra's VACCiNE 2 input system . VACCiNE 2 is a universal input system that automatically adds support to a multitude of gamepads, without having to manually program them into Fusion yourself. - Fire3 and Fire4 are now associated with B and Y on the default XBOX configuration. - The Player Input Object has been expanded to include Triggers/Bumpers/Stick Click by default . This includes hold values and being read in the Input Reader. - Fire1/2/3/4 now have cardinal directions applied to their name to make it easier to figure out what gamepad button its associated with. - 2-Player Mode has been updated with all of the current changes to RPM . Moving Platforms still isn't quite supported, however. - Fixed an issue where some calcuations were not consistent when Frame Skip was active , such as the player jump height. deltaTime will now maintain a specific value as long as its within the Target FPS range. -RPM's internal framerate cap of 120FPS was removed, though 120FPS is still the recommended maximum. -"_JumpInputMade" in the player mask has been renamed "_TriggerJump". - The jump routine can now be activated by setting "_TriggerJump" in the player Mask to "Y". "PlayerPressedJump" in the Player States Widget replaces "_JumpInputMade"'s original functionality. - The default "JumpInputBuffer" value in the Player Input Widget has been increased to 6. - The intial jump routine now subtracts 2 pixels from Y instead of 1 . This ensures jump will work better at higher framerates. - deltaTime will now always stay at 1 if Frame Skip is disabled. - Added LedgeGrab ClimbUpDelay to the Player Attributes Widget. When the player climbs up a ledge (By default, using the Up key), a delay is activated before the player moves up the ledge. This allows time to play an animation of the character climbing up. -The Player States Widget has a new state for when the ClimbUp routine is activated. - Added Disable Ledge ClimbUp Reposition to the Player Attribute Widget. When active, the player will not automatically go to the top of the ledge after the Climb Up delay. The mask will simply fall off unless instructed to move a different way during the delay. -Added the Ledge Snap detector. This sits between the other two ledge detectors and helps keep the mask locked on the ledge on the Y Axis. If you used Ledge Grab before, it will break without this object! - Added One Button LedgeDrop to the Player Attributes Widget. When active, you simply have to press one button to drop down (Down key by default), as opposed to holding Down and then Jump/Fire 1. - Added Ladder Buffer to the Player Attributes Widget. When enabled, the mask will need to overlap any Ladder object a bit closer to its center before it can grab on to it. Disabling it will keep the old system where you can latch on as long as the mask touches it anywhere. - Added WallSlideJump XSpeed, WallSlideJump YSpeed, and WallSlideDown YSpeed to the Player Attributes Widget. These were originally hard-coded values that controlled how fast the player would move during a Wall Slide routine, but now can be easily modified in the Widget. WallSlideJump affects how far the player will jump off a wall, while WallSlideDown affects how fast the player slides down a wall. Note that the values placed in the Widget will be automatically divided by 10 for the Player Mask. - Added GroundTime to Player States Widget. This simply counts how many frames the player has been on the ground. It automatically resets if the player leaves the ground. - Added Disable BoostX Decel flag to the Player Attributes Widget . This allows BoostX to either hold or continually add towards its base value when active. -Added a horizontal Wind Tunnel gadget, which pushes the player backward when they overlap the object. This object makes use of BoostX and Disable BoostX Decel in the object's behaviors. -Fixed an issue where BoostX wasn't being factored into deltaTime, so it should now maintain the same pace at different framerates. - Added Enable Debug Keys to the Engine Widget. You can use this flag to toggle on or off these fuctions instead of disabling the group in the Event Editor. By default, this option is disabled. - Added Unlink Sprite to Mask to the Engine Widget. When active, the player sprite will no longer attach itself to the player mask. -Angle Detection now works if the player is moving with BoostX. -"PlayerDroppedThruPlatform" in the Player States Widget will now reset to "N" if the player's YSpeed is lower than 0. - Fixed an issue where Manual Position on the Master Camera Object did not function properly. All of the events that originally containted actions that moved the Camera (including those found in the Movement, Pushout, and Room Camera groups) were consoldaited into the Camera Setup group. These actions are now disabled when Manual Position is activated. - Fixed an issue where the player could get stuck in scenery if they tried to jump under a very low ceiling. RPM now forces Crouch Jump to activate if it detects a low ceiling while the player is crouching, preventing the mask from changing size when you jump. _CrouchJumpCheck was added to the Engine Widget to detect if Crouch Jump was enabled at the start of the frame. If not, Crouch Jump will disable itself once the ceiling is clear. - Fixed an issue where the player would be pushed back if they crawled into a wall while in a tight space. -Fixed an issue where the player could still jump in mid-air if they set Max Jumps to 1. -Fixed an issue where the player couldn't climb up properly if the mask was standing on the ground. - Fixed an issue where Jump Buffer could be repeatidly triggered by hold both the Left and Right keys simutaneously. -The Floor Detector can now detect ladders from a further distance when standing over one. -The conveyer gadget now uses BoostX to move the player instead of using RePosX directly. -The Super Basic Stage now has a small area to test crouch jumps, and a sloped area that goes into a ceiling. Also added are new curved sloped platforms in various areas. - The Quick Reference guide has been updated to reflect the current version of RPM Plus. Note that it may go over features not found in the Standard or Super Basic Edition of RPM. In order to download this asset pack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $4.99 USD. You will get access to the following files: View all posts Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. i have noticed that when the mask collides with the edge of a solid object the mask freezes if its absolute speed is anything other than 0 if its 0 you can just jump or move away Could be cheaper Metronome Widget seems broken on mfa D: Iâll take a look at it once Iâm free again. Admittedly I havenât looked at this thing in 2 years so uh, I gotta see if I still remember how it works. >_> when 8 direction is on, even though i disable the jumping flag, it still jumps. it seems to be forcing the jumping flag to be on when I start the frame. I just wanna know how to do Slope Momentum :c Which version of RPM are you using? The Standard and Plus version includes a rudementary check that can lower the player's maximum speed using the Angle Detection widget based on the angle of the current slope (starting at 45Â°). It isn't Sonic levels of slope physics (Sonic Worlds engine covers that aspect), but rather something basic to build off from. The free Super Basic Edition only includes features that was in the original version of RPM, which doesn't include that object. man, i don't have money to buy the standard or plus one. Awesome! how i can install it? :c , i'm new using clickteam fusion Depending on what version of Fusion you have, you can open up either the Standard or Plus (which requires the Fusion 2.5+ DLC) of RPM. It requires certain extensions to open up, though Fusion should give you the option to download the required files. It comes with a basic stage showing off the main features of RPM and a blank frame you can build your project from. If youâre brand new to Fusion, Iâd actually recommend getting more accustomed to how the program works and check out some tutorials on YouTube first. Though RPM is simple enough to let you apply a character and give it the essential movements right away (just add a character sprite to the player group and itâll do the rest), it requires intermediate to advanced knowledge of Fusion to fully customize it. There is a quick start guide for RPM and Iâm open to answer a few questions about it, but I would get your feet a bit wet first before diving in. :) i just quickly took a look. its improving a lot. are you aware the camera shakes (horizontally) , when you are hanging onto a ledge. (v22) I am now. :P I'm not sure how I missed that but I'll see if I can squeeze in another hotfix once I figure out what's going on. Should be fixed now. The issue was due to the mask being pushed forward in order to snap on to a ledge. Hi, just want to re-confirm. Can we use a purchased asset to more than one game? Or it just licensed as a single product (one license for one game only). You can use RPM in as many projects as you like, I just ask that you mention that it was used in development (I.e. a logo or in the credits). :) wow that's great thanks! :D This is really cool! Its so cool to see the projects other people have made in Clickteam! You should check out my clickteam platformer engine i put together not to long ago! Hello, I purchased this asset from Clickstore, and it is still in version 1802. How can I get the updated version? (Could've sworn I've replied to this a while ago, but I don't see the post on the main page so...) Send me a PM on the Clickteam forums (ragem) with your Clickstore order number and name, and I'll generate a key for you. :) Hey! I've purchased quite a while ago, but only now got the opportunity to work with it. Is it compatible with other screen resolutions? Say, if I wanted to have a game available in 1920x1080, 1280x720, 1366x768, etc... What would I need to change to make it work? Thank you very much. :) If you're changing the resolution, you'll need to adjust the Global Values "Resolution X" and "Resolution Y" to match the screen size. If you're using the Room Camera Widget (it's the orange R box, it's not created at the start), you'll also need to change the Window Width/Height values as well. These are primarily for the camera object to properly lock it's position when it reaches the edge of the screen. If you're using your own camera system then you don't need to worry about them too much. Thanks for the support btw! :D You have no idea how happy I am that it's this simple, hahah! Thanks a bunch for being so quick to answer. :) Hello. I purchased!! But I'm not good at English. So I want to translate it little by little, but do you have document files etc? Or is there any information in the .mfa file? Thank you very much. All of the documentation is in the .mfa file, as part of the Event Editor and a small guide on the Frame Editor. :) Thank you reply!! I always wish you good luck and keep up the great work! I purchased this asset from Clickstore, and it is still in version 1502. Did Clickstore end support? It shouldn't have, it's supposed to be on the same version as this one. I don't have direct control over the listing on Clickstore, so I have to re-submit it to them whenever I need an update posted. I'll have to take a look into it when I get more free time. In the meantime, if you provide me with your Clickstore order number and name, I can provide access to the itch.io download. :) Ok, I sent you order information via Twitter DM. Howdy Rage! Long time no see! Good job getting featured in a Clickteam collection! Aw snaps man how ya been?! It's been too long ;_; Good to here from ya again! Yeah I gotta say I was totally not expecting Clickteam to back RPM like that, so I guess I did something right. :P Clickteam collection? Where I can see this? Well, congratulations, you deserve this attention!</TEXT>

I was sad to see that change, but I mean.. artists gotta eat and the pack is def still worth it. yeah, I get that, but at least in my opinion, what they should have done is make a paid version with more content, not make something free into a paid thing Awesome asset pack, I love it! For autotiling, I carved out some pieces from the tileset to import into tilesetter to try and make something that worked with Godot's auto tiling. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for me since I just wanted some assets to play around with. Thanks again for your work! Actually very cool! Thanks so much for this beautiful asset pack! It was just the thing I needed for my uni games programming project!</TEXT>

Yes, all my assets can be used commercially, you don't even have to give attribution, thought it's appreciated of course :) Are you still working on anything? I had previously been considering joining your patreon until I noticed you hadn't posted anything in it since 2022. do you think you could add zip or 7z archives for this project and ancient ruins? rar programs donât work on all operating systems, even now. thanks! I miss some water sprites else its a 10/10 :) Hmm, good point, this tileset could use an animated water tile. I'll add it soon! Hey. I am realy interesting to make a game out of your tilsets the art is amazing u dont see art like this common. the only queston i have is: Will in it in the future be a DESERT, SNOW, LAVA Bioms??

If you have not yet downloaded the free package with the basic animations, download it now at the link below: Yes, I made some bonuses for you to use. In addition to the character animation, this pack also comes with 1 Tileset, 1 Enemy with 3 animations, some effects and a portrait of our black knight.

Great looking asset, any chance of a sale in the near future? :) Sorry for the long delay, I haven't seen Itchio's page in a long time, nor was I notified of your question. But I didn't understand it, it's already for sale. Wow this is pretty good style. Rating this 5 stars! Thank you Hi I was just wondering if the background layers were available? I would love to use them and turn them into a parallax background if they weren't already. Thanks Sorry I answer this post but for some reason it wasn't and I only realized now that there was no comment. The purpose of this asset was not to have a background/tileset, it was more of a bonus. Thats absolutely fine, just seemed a shame to see such a beautiful background not being used, would you mind if I turned the background into multiple layers myself and used those for my project? I really love this asset, its so cool and has such a nostalgic feel to it :D You can do it if you want. I didn't think the background was good, I was going to change it, but since it didn't give much financial return, the work I had to make the assets wasn't paid even close, so I didn't even bother to improve it to post and make other areas. I even made more enemy assets and tried to put them separately, but no good results, it was very frustrating. I used this asset pack to create a game that will be available on Steam. Dungeon Knight Cooool :) Can I get promotional pictures of the game package? If possible, can we separate each layer? This is just a promotional art, I only have this whole one without being separated. I never thought anyone would want this art Thanks the reply, I want this promotional artï¼Can I get this promotional art and use it as a game poster? Yes, you can =D Quero comprar o pacote sou brasileiro como faÃ§o para entrar em contato? Uma pessoa jÃ¡ teve o mesmo problema, entrou em contato comigo pelo e-mail (como descrevi no post) e fez o pagamento via pix que era o Ãºnico jeito. Enviei o pacote para ele, mas como falei para ele, quando tiver atualizaÃ§Ã£o, vocÃªs devem entrar em contato comigo que eu reenvio o pacote. quanto fica o preÃ§o por pix? Mesmo preÃ§o, eu converto o dolar do dia Hi, really cool character, i'm having fun building my game with it! i have a suggestion, a push animation (like pushing a block) would be a great addition Hi, thanks a lot. I already thinking about this animation push and pull. It may take a while but I'll try to update the asset :D I'm trying to purchase your pack but for some reason it doesn't work with Brazillian cards, or even paypal =( I was able to purchase other packs without any issues. Any suggestions? Very strange, I think another Brazilian has already bought this asset before. I replied via email to you =) Amazing work!!! Thank you Amazing asset, I'm going to have lots of fun playing around with this. The character portrait is a really nice addition and the animation list is really impressive. Great work! Thank you :) Hello Great asset, I love the artistic design and the smooth animations ! Just a quick question, do you think it will be possible to get the aseprite files of the knight itself ? I actually just want the knight without the weapons so if you happen to still have the aseprite files or just normal PNG files without the weapons and shield, that would be amazing, thank you ! I can put aseprite file or export without the weapons, but my file Aseprite It's a mess, unfortunately, it has several messy layers. Now regarding PNG, some animations (I think only the attacks) are very confusing. But if you still want I can put one of the two, but I won't have time to adjust everything right now. If you can just put the PNG files of the most clean one, so the ones that don't need adjustement, it would be awesome! Even if it's only few animations Thank you again, appreciated! I'll try do this today or tomorrow =D Take your time, I am really not trying to rush you in any way ! Hey, I update and add other animation too. =D it's so cool~ i like it would you want make some sprite of 5 or 6 head body Thanks. I didn't understand the question The head to body proportion is six or five Maybe in another asset pack, but I'm going to work more on this asset. I can't put characters of different styles in the same package, it doesn't make sense. This style you told me might be Castlevania's style, I don't know. What a fantastic array of animations. Most assets on this platform invest all the quality into the character visuals and end up with basic and few animations. You seem to have balanced both. Definitely going to purchase for my upcoming Soulslike! Thanks, appreciate your feedback. I will update this asset further whenever possible =) Hi just bought the pack, the content is well organized and the content is very promising ! I can't find the idle animation for the knight. Is it normal ? edit : +1 for ladder animation ;) Thanks in advance and best regards Hey, thank you. The idle, walk, jump and others animations there are in Basic pack (free). There are a link on at the beginning this text, but I put here for you to download. https://skullbrow.itch.io/hero-knight-platformer-basic What a noob I am. Thank you very much ! You're welcome, it can happen to anyone. =) Hello, I update this asset and did the animation up/down ladder animation. wow thank you for the support ! hello,I can't buy your asset because it shows the message:Your card is not supported for this currency. You can only charge Brazilian cards in BRL in Brazil. do you have another form of payment?(sorry for my english) Hello, are you Brazilian? Payment platforms only accept paypal and Mastercard and Visa cards. I wanted to accept other types of cards, but I am not allowed. Hello! Great quality animations. I miss ladder up/down movements. Thank you! Thank you. I even thought about doing it, but depending on the number of orders here I can update it Hello, I update this asset and did the animation up/down ladder animation.</TEXT>

Lots of flutes, big orchestral arrangements for your dramatic moments, and jazzy bops for your fun, whimsical parts. Look somewhere in between Mario and the Legend of Zelda and youâll find this soundtrack. You can preview the whole thing here: https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1349716405&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true Evolving Themes Looking for something that works as a soundtrack, and not just a collection of songs? Most of the songs call back to earlier tracks, and thereâs a set of themes that evolve over the course of the pack. I try to tell stories with my soundtracks, to make it easier for you to do the same in your game. Customizable Every time one of my songs has multiple, distinct parts, Iâve included an âExtrasâ folder with a separate, loopable .wav file for each subsection. Want to loop the ambient intro over and over again until the action ramps up, then start looping the part where the drums kick in? Want to play through the track in its entirety and have the tension ebb and flow over the course of a scene? Just need the hardest-hitting parts of the song to loop for your battle scenes? Those are all broken out into separate files, so you can use the parts that work best for your game, precisely when you need them. *** Album art: topcreativemindz https://www.instagram.com/topcreativemindz/ https://www.fiverr.com/topcreativemind In order to download this soundtrack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $5 USD.

Interested in adults games ? Check out https://proadultgames.pages.dev/ We publish 18+ game builds and updates at https://adultparadise.pages.dev/ really fun! stuff is good man! Now THIS is actually interesting. Interactive with graphs and all the necessary information. Actual good content. If only your videos were as informative. Excuse me, BRO DID A WHOLE 20 MINUTE VIDEO ON WHY CELESTE FEELS SO GOOD AND THE EXACT NUMBERS Nice so handy nice Really interesting concept. Nice to play around :) Really interesting and nice to play around, but this is more about platformers as in "precision" ones, would be fun to have presets for games like "SotN", "Ori", "Hollow Knight" that are platfomers, but should have a different feel and snappier controls. AMAZING like I am so impressed! only if it has Map editors... but still I loved it and I'm not saying this to you b'cuz you must do it I'm just asking I wish this had an import into Godot button ð amazing! the game flashes sometimes for me Can you add touch controls wgere us fullscreen do you know about auto-correct? no chat, do i tell him? Nah he'll figure it out on his own You misspelt "where is". Found a crazy glitch, when you open the toolkit, you still move around, but you take no damage from spickes and stuff! scroll wheel is too slow a bit disappointing that a creator who has spent a long time talking about accessibility in games didnt include a basic accessibility feature like control remapping. still really cool regardless. bro when u turn the time scale down its SUPER DUPER CREEPY BRO that might be the point way way way way way too much talking. please make more of these but add a skip button, thanks! dude it's an educational video essay it's supposed to have talking. Also there's a skip button already... It's a tool and the skip button doesn't show up for a long while into using it. Mark's Video essays are on youtube, not itch. Just trying to provide constructive feedback on the tool, a comment if you will. "Platformer Toolkit is an interactive video essay, from the creator of Game Maker's Toolkit." Literally the first sentence in the description. So it's named "Platformer Toolkit" literally a toolkit for platforming. but self described as a video essay? so which is it. The ambiguity is there, my feedback is valid for a "Platformer toolkit" whats in the display banner/name, but not valid for a "video essay" sure. What's up your but that a commet cant give feedback to the project anyway? Marks entire channel is giving feedback to games and their design, I think if he can dish it out he can take some on his own projects lol. oh wow, not like his name is Game Maker's Toolkit and thats why its named Platformer Toolkit Read the description before you download the product. It's that simple. Really ridiculous comment everyone else is wrong this guys right i win good bye Enjoyable time playing this and very educational! Even if you know most of this stuff, it's nice to have a little tool to play around with in real time. You should add arrow controls, i can barely try this out since space is throwing my browser down and I can't download the game. yea, they should make w/up jump mac? It has support for most devices. have you tried downloading it. Can't download it This is such a great tool. I discovered by accident a neat "feature": you can put this tool on one monitor and your game on the other monitor, and use one controller to control play both games at the same time. So you can compare them in real time and adjust yours to match Kit's movement. Great game to learn, practice and enjoy :) game is good and fun game good graphics good play ability good game aproved This is the most useful tool for making a platformer character controller ! I learned so much things in so little time while having fun, INCREDIBLE ! This is actually pretty sick but I cant seem to turn off the Instant movement option I had the same issue. It looks like the UI for deceleration handle is drawn on top of the Instant movement checkbox, so if your deceleration handle is all over to the right, you will not be able to click the Instant movement checkbox. So what you have to do is to move deceleration handle to the left, disable the checkbox and then move the handle to the right again. LOVE IT is so good â¤ï¸ SO GOOD! holy bro so much yap It's a game meant to teach... what did you expect not that much yap Then your expectations were terrible, and your brain is rotted. You sound like youâre like 12 if youâre unironically saying âyapâ. yap yap yap brainrot dude its an interactive video essay its gonna have a lot of talking ok yapatron if you dont like the "yapping" why not FIND ANOTHER GAME Is the background music "All Nighter" by Ibrahim? I have been searching for this song EVERYWHERE thank you so much Fun And Engaging... ability to test what style of controller You want. Informative and pleasant. Appreciating Your hard work! Thanks, Dev, for a nice experience. ....But To actually code FEELS So much "easier"))) (not by dragging visual handles) Have A GREAT TIME everyone!!! my computer says its a virus false positive true plus you can use the web version.

I thought you can set your control by change the number and the bar in the image, and you can make custom level, and im ready to troll my friend with my minigame, and then i get this, lol d The code and video are extremely useful and professional. I love the banner. These tips are applicable to users of other game engines as well. (eg. Godot) I now understand that great control scehemes are created this way: Exactly! Super happy it helped you out, love those takeaways Nice demo! This shows the difference between these platformers very well. Hollow Knight's unaccelerated and relatively slow movement is why I didn't like it that much. The walljump behaviour of Celeste was a bit different than in this demo iirc. Celeste would not jump far away off the wall but short staying near it, if the direction key was not pressed when pressing jump on a wall. The short walljump is not in this Celeste demo, however she couldn't rise by walljumping, that's correct. Also there is a strange air-dash when pressing shift. However, I'm excited you're onto a new game! I liked COSMOS very much and am looking forward to whatever you plan next! Good luck! :-) Hey there LinkBlade! Thanks so much, yeah for a future video on jumps recreating Celeste's wall jump more faithfully is definitely on my to-do list. So happy you enjoyed COSMOS, thanks!</TEXT>

I am trying to buy the book and i am getting and error by PayPal: Hey there, thank you a lot for getting in touch! Are you from Brazil? For some reason, itch.io doesn't allow Brazilians to purchase from other Brazilians using PayPal. You can use Stripe instead, or get the book on my Ko-fi instead, using the link below you will have the same 50% discount. https://ko-fi.com/ludensludonaut/link/BABY50 Yes, I'm from Brazil. I tried to make all the payment methods on the link you sent (ko-fi), but it gave me the same error message. Could you check what other payment methods there would be, if any? Thank you. what version of Godot use this book , seams to be old one? do you update the book to new version 4.4.1 stable ? It's 4.0! I have to update it indeed! Hello! I am trying to buy the book and i am getting and error by Stipe: Hey there! Thank you for your support and for leaving a comment! itch.io sometimes gives these kinds of issues. I'd recommend you try Ko-fi instead. Link to the Ko-fi's book page: https://ko-fi.com/s/8df29350d8 As always, this is pure gold! Highly recommended to anyone interested in furthering their Godot skills! Truly love to see it. Not sure when I will get around to it but love to see stuff like this and this looks very thorough, polished, and well-done. Thanks for contributing to the community!! Thank you for this comment! This means a lot to me. The pleasure is mine to contribute to this awesome community. I hope you get around it soon! Looking forward your feedback, froggie! Wow. Good job, do you planning make the same for 3d? Thank you! I do, it's planned for future books in this series! hi. I already bought the package and the book, but when I want to import the files to my godot it doesn't allow me to import them, it gives me an error, do you have a solution to that? Hey there, thank you so much for your support! Could you post an image of the error? Hey there, you need to select the .zip file instead of the folder. Take a look at the latest video to understand this process better. The following link you guide you directly to the section of the video where I import some assets into a project: It has very good information but very confusing. I don't understand inheritances or how to extend a script. Could you help me? I'm in the basic movement and controls. How can I extend the script and how can I make the other recipes? I don't understand. Could you help me? Hmm from what I can understand you don't have a programming background, right? Check out this series of mine, where I talk about inheritance, this may help! Hello, your book seems really neat. I've tried to purchase it through Itch.io and Kofi but both websites have declined my card. I'm wondering if it's on my end or if it's a regional problem, (I'm in the US and I think another user had issues) Hey there...does your card emits any report? The only country I know has issues with payments is Brazil. What about trying again Hello, sorry for the late response, but yeah my payment went through. The book is good Tried to buy it but it seams that Stripe can't process my card :( Any other purchase options (I don't use PayPal)? Hmm, that's weird... could you try to acquire it on Ko-fi instead? https://ko-fi.com/s/8df29350d8 Someone acquired a commission using stripes there, so I think it should work Worked as a charm, thanks :) Hey Pigdev, are the recipes exclusive for Godot 4? From what I understand, a lot of things were changed from 3 to 4 and I am still stuck on 3.5, slowly going through the GDQuest course. Kinda wondering if I shouldn't move to Godot 4, but the GDQuest course is for 3.5, so... Anyways, good stuff. Yes! All recipes are made using Godot Engine 4.0. I highly recommend you trying to apply the knowledge from GDQuest on newer versions of Godot. If I'm correct, they will update their courses to Godot Engine 4.0 anyway. Tho, besides breaking changes, the changes are interchangeable. We can go through the process of applying the recipes from the book into 3.5 if you're willing to. We can do that gradually through Discord :D Thanks for responding, Piggy! For now, I will focus on finishing the GDQuest course, but I do plan to buy your ebook later on. Dinheiro nÃ£o tÃ¡ fÃ¡cil agora XD That being said, I will try to apply my knowledge so far to Godot 4.0, that sounds like a good challenge :) all good! Tho, don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need some help with this 4.0 endeavor ð·ð If i click the download button directly above the devlog sectio, i only get access to two files about bump enemies. where are the download links for the other files? Hey! I sent an email to all customers about this issue. You can check your inbox and reply to the email to get an access key to all previous and future files. Everything is explained in the email, thanks for your patience! ð i didnÂ´t get such an e-mail. I sent this email to all customers that bought the book, please check your spam box if you supported the book previously. Otherwise, if you are still to get the book, please support it with the respective pledge to get access to the files you want. The 2 free files about the Bump Enemy are free samples from the actual book. Hi Pigdev, Hope your good :) I seem to have lost access to Platformer Essential Assets - Early Access Platformer Essentials Game - Early Access Tia Hey Ragell! Thanks for reaching out. Could you contact me through email? I'll provide a personal key. You can reply the recently sent email as well, check your inbox! When when wheeen?! *screams* hehe, I'm proofreading! It's halfway done, I just finished the PathFollowEnemy recipe, there are 5 recipes left. I'll write an update post about it! Sorry for the lack of communication. hahahahhaa. Ok ok. A great job always requires time. I will wait. I bought your Top 7 Godot recipe and it was great. Im confused though about the Essential Godot bundle, If you buy the bundle is it means you get all future recipe? or just the 2 first recipes ? Hey there! Thanks a lot for your support ð·ð Buying one of the Godot Essentials Recipes ebooks gives you free access to the BUNDLE. The Bundle, which will be a single ebook, will be a standalone product. So buying one ebook will give you access to it once I publish it. Each ebook until then is a standalone product as well. This way, people can buy just the one that actually interests them for a lower price, as the bundle will be a bit expensive. Nonetheless, you get a 25% permanent discount on all future releases of the Godot Essential Recipes until the Bundle comes out. So, you sir(or miss) can access this very Platformer Essentials ebook with 25% permanent discount.

<TEXT>Hey there, This is my first try on making a platformer. its pretty simple has only 5levels that you need to finish in the shortest time with the lowest deaths and highest collected apples. I used free art from the awsome artist PixelFrog. Pixel Frog website : https://pixelfrog-store.itch.io/ as for the audio i used a random sound effect generator and free sound track. hope you enjoy playing, have fun. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Stuck on level 4, always hitting my head down when I'm trying to jump to the small platform with spikes great game tho, loving the mechanics Btw if you dont move u can't be damaged by the fire in lvl 5 Really enjoyable game, and amazing level designs. Loved it really cool first game. Boutta grind for th best possible time :) grinding deathless Amazing Very nice :) level 2 is so hard and annoying I have already died 33 time and can't get to the upper level, but the game is really good though control and sound effect are amazing Jumping is kinda broken but the rest are okay. 6/10 APROVED BY PAPAJKA It's pretty good as for your first project, but I have advice for you. All pixel art should be pixel perfect. In your game some sprites are distorted or have bigger resolutions than other difficulty curve too steep I love it. but sometimes when I double jumped I couldn't move :( It was a good game! It was quite hard at times but really fun to play Hahah, I love the protagonist design Level 1 and level 2 is like level 1 to level 10 could you pass me all the source code to see how it is made? Pass it to me here kkernoxx@gmail.com. Thx :) and really good work is there a download? This game is super cool, love the main character. 111 deaths and got all the apples and time is 11:21:53 The game is great 1 problem though it's to hard. True This game is great under rated game very cool game WOW!! cool platformer game i like it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable tool This is a simple template for use with Construct 2 to create a platform game. I created this for use with an after-school club. I've created a number of documents to accompany the template to illustrate how to create your own levels and add them to the game. I hope to continue adding more features to the template and documenting these, please let me know if there is anything you specifically want to see! The template makes extensive use of assets by Kenney so I highly recommend checking out his offerings here on itch or at his website . Additionally the music was taken from The Open Game Art Bundle and sound effects created with Bfxr . I will continue updating the PDF with instructions on how to use the various functions included in the template until I am satisfied that everything is covered, so remember to check back from time to time. I also hope to develop the template further and will update the .capx file when I do so. Any updates will be listed here, but feel free to make requests in the comments!

Florian is a genius and I'm really excited to see where he takes GDevelop next. Unfortunately, as amazing as Florian is, he did not create the assets used in the platformer template included in GDevelop. Those assets were created by Kenney and can be seen on his website ( http://kenney.nl/ ) or alternatively, here on itch where he sells them as bundles - https://kenney.itch.io/ . I highly recommend Kenney's assets if you are (like me) a terrible artist! Even if you are pretty talented at art (or have someone on your team who is) they can still be brilliant for rapidly creating prototypes. If you take another look at the description for my Platformer Template you'll see that I credit Kenney for creating the assets. Thanks for your feedback!</TEXT>

Can you send it again? yes sure, can you write me an email to 2dgamearts@gmail.com Hi, I would buy these assets. I'm just wondering: will I find the animations of the Turrets? Can they walk? oh yes the turret has a walk animation. It would be too much work to show all animations here so what I did was to show some samples for each character. But yes turret can walk and even jump and do this super beam thing and more :D Any chance we can get a climbing animation that matches your ladder asset? How much more? Thanks Hi there, I've been working on a 2d plat-former engine for about a month and now that I've got it mostly in place I've been trying to decide on art. I bought the assets pack you have and I'm about to purchase the character pack. Could you please let me know if you release anymore tile sets or characters. would love to base the graphics of this game around your art style :) thanks Hi david first thank you for the support. Yes I have a lot of assets in mind for the future. Especially to complete the cyberpunk asset I also wanted to make a cyberpunk themed GUI set. However I barely find free time to work on these projects. So you would probably wait a long time before you get any new assets in this style published. Instead if you need some special characters or tilesets done for your game we can arrange a custom work for you which I can accomplish faster. For a custom job you have contact me at 2dgamearts@gmail.com and we can discuss the details Thank you again. Good luck with your game!</TEXT>

Unfortunately I had not nearly enough time to even slightly finish this off, and I will add a lot of features over the time, so right now there is practically no benefit to use it. But still, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try it out. Current features (will change a lot over time): Planned features: COMMENTED CODE SOON! This is not a usual library. I don't know yet how to make a real one so you just have to deal with it. Put the .pde file in your sketch folder and everything will work. You can look at the example sketch to see everything you can do with it, and (obviously) at the source code too since it is simply another processing file. Thank you for trying this out and I hope you like it at least a little bit. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.

<TITLE>Platformer AJAX</TITLE>
<TEXT>Platformer AJAX was a prototype for a platform game that has yet to see full development. Paper design for the full game was done, and it may be returned to at some point, but until further notice this is the final form of the project codenamed Platformer AJAX. The game features ledge grabbing, double jumping, gravity flipping, keys and doors, and simple enemies. Other features such as wall jumping were implemented into earlier versions of the prototype, but were removed from later variants due to design reasons. Currently contact with an enemy from the side or below will result in the game restarting. Controls: -Arrow keys for movement -'E' to interact with gravity control stands Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Really cute game. I love the animation of the main characther,it so fun to watch him move around,whit his litte arms moving around haha And the music,omg,so nice,really fits with the character design,the second song is amazing men I am listening to the music while i am wrinting this and i cant get enough if it hah Its kinda hard as it does not have chekpoints,but overall a fun experience,keep it up men! Thank you, Skache! I appreciate your time. Yes, this is a very unfinished prototype. I had some design ideas for expanding upon this into a full game, but it wasn't something I was overly passionate about. The core mechanic I wanted to drive home was the key. In this prototype it just kind of follows you around, but I wanted the big physical key to be the driving game mechanic, with the player holding it in their hand, and having all sorts of uses: While also having negatives, like: I really wanted to experiment with going as far as I could with one item. Maybe I'l return to it someday! srry for the grammar, english is not my first language (neither second or something like this, xD)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Platformer Mod</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod For Nuclear Throne Together (v9921 or above) Credit to " s ometimes o pens g amemaker" for the foundation of this mod. Permission to modify and publish granted. This mod turns Nuclear Throne into a side-scroller - players, most enemies, and some projectiles now have gravity applied to them. Turning a game into a side-scroller without changing much wouldn't be fun, so the movement system has been expanded upon: There are some area-specific things too, but I'll leave those to your discovery. If you find a bug, visit the Nuclear Throne Discord #mod_discussion page and ping me there. Loading mods Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. i keep getting a compiling error Really love this mod and the concepts put into it, but I do feel like all the other interesting movement tech is mostly aesthetic flare with the current state of the walljump ability. You can scale just about any wall and regain your double jump off of any surface, which does seem like a fair way to prevent levelgen softlocks but doesn't inspire much creative use of the other mechanics. I think something like a celeste wallclimb and dash mechanic would probably suit the drift-jump and bolt climbing mechanics better. That, and I find the drift-jump incredibly strict to pull off. Seems like there's at most 2-3 frames to switch directions and jump, which tends to leave me mashing the keys when I need to pull it off.

DOES work on Steam Deck does this run on playdate? ive seen it added to some playdate game collections recently. you should add the "playdate" tag if so ;) I came here wondering the same thing, the graphics would work great on the Play.Date, so hopefully they port it and sell it on the Catalogue at some point! If it's MINIT then it's MINIT I really enjoyed this one. Might actually give the main game a chance. This game would be perfect for the Playdate! do you know if they ever ported it? Working 100% under Linux with Wine / Lutris! what gameengine used to make i Gamemaker Studio looks really neat ! but needs a linux version :^| A native version would be nice, but since there's been no response to this an a year, have you considered using something like Wine? I've had some success with it before. I'm also finding something called Lutris. I haven't tried it out personally, though, so can't say how well it works. I use wine from time to time. And it works often but not always. I usually donât buy a game if Iâm not sure I can play itâ¦ Iâll have a look at Lutris it looks great, thanks for the tip. Also, I had the opportunity to try Minit Fun Racer on a windows and itâs as good as it looks! Good luck with Lutris. I hope it works great for you! I'm eager to try this game. The new bundle has me buried in so many new games ð¬ You can also run it via the linux version of Steam, you need to use the Add Non Steam Game to Library function. Once you have added it to the library you right click on the name of the game and change the compatibility to use Proton Experimental. Lutris / Wine is running fine. All Windows games from the Ukraine bundle i have tried worked fine with wine / lutris Works perfectly with Proton! I'm brazilian, how can i get the game? They have a steam link https://store.steampowered.com/app/1503530/Minit_Fun_Racer/ Thank you <3 ! which charity? https://twitter.com/jwaaaap/status/1362434035776126976?s=20 What a great game! I really loved minit, and this is a perfect minigame take on both the mechanics and graphics. Congrats on another soon to be classic game! Works great on Linux through Wine if anyone is wondering. Seems broken under Sway though. Can't interact with the window at all. Tested on Manjaro via i3 Any chance for a MacOS version? Yep, Iâd like that, too. Just downloaded it 30 minutes ago and getting that Shader Error on start. :( Added an alternate download link for minit_racer_itch_noshader.zip that should work as long as you don't change the brightness/darkness settings. Sorry about that! Thank you! :3 I'm getting the same Vortex Shader error on the Steam version, are you able to update that version as well?

I passed it. Yay I've tried it just now and discovered that it's impossible to line up for jumping through a one block gap after entering the metroid filled corridors too early. smol samus have big brain heheehe wud benefit from the controls written in the map at starting location. shift/etc rather than c for firing wud make it easier 1 handed. web player..buggy yes. collsion with the bat things needs fix, they seem to have a crossshape hibox, jumping up beside them away from their animation still kills u. other than that, very cool, esp the graphics. Tried out the windows download version... is there controller support? because it seemed to crash on me at the title screen after I pressed a couple of buttons trying to start it. Also: There was another "Minitroid" a while back ("tech demo" from like 2011, at least that's what the file dates say) is this by chance a more complete version of that one? Nope, sorry, no controller support! Iâve seen this other project, itâs just the same name, not related to this project ð Ah okay! Thanks for the timely replay! Guess I'll give it a try later when I can do it with easier access to my keyboard. But it looks great, are you submitting this to the metroidvania jam as well? Seems like it'd fit in perfectly. mmmm I was thinking I would probably try to work on something a bit longer for the metroidvania, given itâs a whole month! But right now Iâm playing with a few different frameworks, tinkering with the idea of building my own layer above a framework, etc :) Very well done! Short, sweet and a nice usage of limited pixel space. Awesome short metroid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game Description: Jenny's house looks so beautiful that the slimes believe it is a cake and coming to eat it. Defend the house before the slimes eating it up. You have 2 candies, you can use them to tame slimes, and they will fight for you. Control: A/D or Arrows = move Z/K = jump X/L = Put a candy Note: I'm still working on stages and level design. And lack of SoundFX and victory screens, and more characters with different abilities... Yeah, lots of missing. The game is half done because I'm suffering from procrastination, I'm sorry about that. Should you feel boring or upset, I have a plan B in game, just watch the slimes eating your house piece by piece, and it's also a kind of fun. Feel free to vote any stars, I believe this game will be awesome when I finished it. I'll update this soon, please stay tuned! :) Credits: Music by Pan Ye. Everything else by Pan Feng. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. What a cute and fun idea! I like the aesthetic and the premise for a tower defense game with candies and taming enemies to use against other enemies...you have a great basis for continuing the game further. If you were to continue this, I would say that the fact that the girl can jump on enemies practically renders the candies useless. But it was just that one level, so that might be something to explore in future levels, with different abilities where the need to have additional helpers to kill the enemy slimes would be helpful. I look forward to seeing this one expanded; I think it has a lot of potential. Thanks! There will be a huge improvement when it complete, please stay tuned :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>MiniTowerDefense - LD44</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is my first time participating in Ludum Dare! This time the theme was "Your life is your currency" so I made a simple tower defence game where you spend health to build towers. Click anywhere to place a tower, which will decrease your health. Click on an existing tower to sacrifice it, and your health will increase by the number of enemies that tower killed. When an enemy reaches the end of a path, you lose health. Think of this as a very quick TD game, or even, "the dark souls of tower defense" ;). There's a bit of luck required with the RNG for enemy spawns to gain momentum, but the challenge is in managing your towers and sacrificing the most productive ones to regain health. If your health drops to zero, game over! POST-SUBMISSION CHANGES: - attempting to fix bug where super fast enemies would take 2 health instead of 1 - reduce super-fast enemy and super-heavy enemy spawn rates, increase basic enemy spawn rates Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Fun game but you can keep going forever eventually. After score 3083 and having 2134 hearts I quit because it became boring</TEXT>

Before each encounter with a new foe, you will make a choice that changes how your attacks behave. Some changes are small, some are bigger. These choices will create crazy combinations as they stack with each other and force interesting different playstyles The game was created using Unreal Engine 5 in a 7-week time period of a team consisting of 14 members. The theme for the game was âWhat Ifâ, so we created a system that lets you choose from a variety of options on how you shoot your projectiles. Want to do as much damage as possible but shoot twice as fast? We got you! Want your shots to curve and bend with twice the size of your normal projectile? No problem! This system lets the player to play the game in multiple different ways, one or more playstyles to suit them all. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Command a fearless mini-tank and fight through zombie-infested wastelands! Upgrade your armor and weapons, destroy emitter towers, and grow stronger with every battle. Controls Keyboard and Mouse: Gamepad: Game Features Are you ready to take on the challenge and cleanse the wastelands of evil? Hop into your tank and head into battle! Join Discord Join YouTube Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I like a lot of the choices that were made with this. The game does indeed contain Xbox controller plug-and-play support. That support seems to work well everywhere, except the exiting screen (the furthest-right screen in the Tab menu). The Xbox support is excellent, because it's specific to Xbox controllers, and is not generic. In other words, if you use a generic controller, and plug the game's keyboard/mouse defaults into JoyToKey, the game will still cooperate with the custom layout. So, yes - the game is compatible with hundreds of controllers. It's wonderful. There were three small things that bothered me. 1) It's possible to enter the Tab menu, by clicking on the upper-left white menu. That functionality is not necessary, because you can already enter the menu, with Tab. 2) The mouse cursor is really difficult to see. I wish it was thicker, and black and white. 3) There doesn't seem to be a way to save progress. Nostalgia, upgrades and challenge — everything as it should be! This simple but catchy game instantly brought me back to my childhood, reminding me of my favorite tanks on Dendy. Despite the current imbalance (enemies do not spare you for a second!), the controls feel pleasant — soft, responsive, without unnecessary jerkiness. The upgrade system pleased — laconic and reliable, like a Swiss watch. The battle with the boss-tower turned out to be tense — sometimes even too much, but this is a matter of balance. In general, the game already looks solid and confident, and with further refinement it will be even cooler. Good luck and inspiration to the author on the way to the final release! ð </TEXT>

<TITLE>MiniTroid (preview)</TITLE>
<TEXT>MiniTroid - The Metroid-like stuck in a time loop! Winner of the Whalepass #2 GameJam. CONTROLS (Controller recommended) : ARROWS / D-PAD / Left Stick : Move & Aim SPACE / A : Jump M / SELECT : Open Map W / X : Shoot X / RB / RT : Dash C / LB : Lock Character in Place (to aim more easily) (Some controls are locked initially) You can drop down ledges with Down (hold) + Jump . Alternative keyboard controls: WASD (move), Shift (shoot), A (Lock), E (Dash) The Game: The player starts the game with only 20 seconds remaining before their suit will self-destruct. As they are stuck in a time loop , they are doomed to repeat these 20 seconds forever. Can you gather enough knowledge during those measly 20 seconds to discover how to open new paths and find a way to delay this curse, or even remove it completely? Theme - Retro Revival: The game is clearly inspired by the original Metroid, with a bit of Metroid Fusion too. I tried to keep it consistent and use a small color palette, 8 bits sounds and music, etc... For the Revival part, I decided to combine a Retro inspired game with a mechanic that hasn't really been done in a Metroidvania before (that I know off)! It's inspired by Minit (hence the portmanteau Title! :)), but with its own spin on the concept. Whalepass Integration: Currently, the "knowledge" gathered in the game is saved as a Whalepass reward, meaning that even on a new computer, connecting to your account will make it so the character knows the code for the upgrades and immediately has them. I would like to add a mode where every player's map is different (including different upgrades), and players would need to trade Whalepass rewards with each other to be able to progress! That would make for a way cooler integration I think, but wasn't really in scope for the duration of the jam. Miscellaneous: Why codes? When the game loop, everything is reset - apart from the sand that's in the hourglass. But the ingame character is able to remember the discovered codes. As a result, they are able to unlock their suit's abilities right away at the start of a new loop, without having to go all the way back to get the upgrade again! :) If you wanna experience the game again, you can temporarily delete your save in the Options menu ("Reset Game"). If you refresh the page, the game will load your progress from Whalepass again so your original save will be back :) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. wow! A mini action game of Metroid & megaman boss battles in great quality! The pixel art made with a good color palette and the atmosphere of the music is irresistible! The time looping is also fun and I really enjoyed it, meow~! Thanks for the let's play! It was fun watching someone play the game :) Had a lot of fun playing this! Great work! I just wish it was longer... Minitroid Walkthrough Nice, thanks for the video :) Really cool game! The jump wasn't very intuitive for me, but the rest 10/10! awesome job! yes ! excellent work !</TEXT>

<TITLE>Minitris 1K</TITLE>
<TEXT>Use the X BUTTON to (re)start. Use the LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN BUTTON S to move your block. Use the X BUTTON to rotate your block. Minitris is a minimalist, endless take on the classic falling-block puzzle, coded in under 1 kilobyte for the Pico-1K Jam. The rules are simple: rotate and place blocks to clear lines, but thereâs no âgame overâ — just an infinite challenge to keep stacking, clearing, and pushing your score higher. Has been coded for the Pico-1k game JAM in September 2025 for the virtual console Pico-8, with a limited code size of 1024 compressed bytes without embedded ressources (sprites & sounds). Any feedback/suggestion is welcome. sebastien.raupp@moult.org Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. It's hard but I think it's because of my slow little brain :') Ahah :) Thanks for your feedback!

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows This project named poorly "MiniTank" is supposed to be a Unity example project based on the Mirror implementation of the multiplayer in Unity3D. THIS IS NOT A GAME in a sense that it's more a game FOR gamedevs than a game for gamers. I just wanted a space to expose the project and itch.io seems to be a good place. I aimed to make a comprehensive, simple yet complete project which can be used as blueprint for a TPS/FPS multiplayer game. Keep in mind that it was a project for me to learn, and to share my discoveries with you. Don't hesitate to comment and PR the code if you have better implementations and ideas. You'll find more informations in the README of the project via the gitlab link bellow. I've spent something like one and a half month on this little thing.

<TITLE>TinyText + MiniText + 3Text</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack I've made a series of fonts for the PICO-8. Each font uses as few sprites and as little code as possible. An 'LS' version of a font uses Less Sprites at the expense of longer code. Here's the PICO-8 forum thread . TinyText : a lowercase font meant for use alongside the uppercase system font. Each character is just 3x4 pixels and aligns to the bottom of the system font, meaning lines of text are still 5 pixels tall and 3-pixel monospaced. The whole font uses just 5 sprites. Can fit 21 lines of text on-screen (the same as the system font). TinyTextLS : the same font as TinyText but with just 4 sprites! MiniText : a prettier lowercase font also meant for use alongside the uppercase system font. Character size varies and can hang below the writing line, meaning lines of text are now 7 pixels tall (but are still 3-pixel monospaced). The code is a bit longer, but the font still only uses 5 sprites. Can fit 16 lines of text on-screen. MiniTextLS : the same font as MiniText but with just 3 sprites! [deprecated, see LRP's Mini] LRP's Mini : the same font as MiniText but packed into just 2 sprites by PICO-8 forum member LRP!! It also uses less code than MiniTextLS, so it's all-round better - use this one instead of MiniTextLS! Find it in the comments on the PICO-8 forum. These fonts come with 3 text rendering functions, plus there's the system print, so we have: - print(str [x y [col]]) the system print function, which "PRINTS IN CAPS". - printlower(str x y [col]) which "prints in all lowercase". - printfirst(str x y [col]) which "Capitalizes just the first word". - printevery(str x y [col]) which "Capitalizes Every Word". 3Text : this is a standalone font that replaces the system font for printing. Every character is just 3x3 pixels and the code is very short, but it uses 10 sprites and is the hardest one to read. Can fit 32 lines of text on-screen. - print3(str x y [col]) Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.

<TITLE>ImgToVdt Image To Minitel Converter$5.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool for Windows A MINITEL (Interactive Medium by Digitization of Telephone Information, or Â« MÃ©dium Interactif par NumÃ©risation d'Information TÃ©lÃ©phonique Â») is a type of computer terminal designed to connect to legacy Videotex service (Teletel). The Minitel still exists, but the Teletel service is not commercially operated in France anymore since 2012. ImgToVdt software allows you to convert an image to Minitel format. For example your JPG image will be transformed into a format a Minitel can understand. A Minitel accepts VideoTex (VDT) format as a base for transmitting information. Each Minitel can display a matrix of 40x24 characters in 8 colors. Any character is 2 pixels wide and 3 pixels high. The output format is the VDT format (by default, it draws line by line, from left to right, but this is configurable). Your "image.JPG" file is therefore converted to an "image.VDT" file. During each conversion, ImgToVdt will also create a PNG image file, which is convenient for previewing what your image will look like on a Minitel, with a regular grayscale or with the actual Minitel palette. The VDT file generated by ImgToVdt must finally be transferred to Minitel. One way to do this is to use: - the RS232 serial port of your Minitel - a "USB to Serial cable" to be plugged on your PC - the COM port - the command 'mode' on Windows Command prompt. Here you will find further information about how to transfer your VDT file to Minitel . When using the control characters you can simulate the cursor movement. Thus it is possible to display the characters in a different order, for example in vertical lines as in "Matrix", or in random pixels order! Read more about these graphical glitches on Minitel . Le MINITEL (ou Â« MÃ©dium Interactif par NumÃ©risation d'Information TÃ©lÃ©phonique Â») est un type de terminal informatique conÃ§u pour se connecter Ã l'ancien service de VidÃ©otex (Teletel). Le minitel existe toujours, mais il n'est plus commercialement exploitÃ© depuis 2012. ImgToVdt est un logiciel convertisseur dâimages qui transforme votre fichier image jpg dans un format comprÃ©hensible pour un Minitel. Un Minitel accepte le format VideoTex (VDT) comme base de transmission des informations. Un Minitel dispose matrice de 40x24 caractÃ¨res en 8 couleurs. Chaque caractÃ¨re fait 2 pixels de large et 3 pixels de haut. Le format de sortie est le format VDT (par dÃ©faut ligne par ligne, de gauche Ã droite, mais ceci est paramÃ©trable). Votre fichier image.JPG est donc converti en fichier image.VDT. Lors de chaque conversion, ImgToVdt va crÃ©er aussi un fichier image PNG, ce qui est pratique pour prÃ©visualiser Ã quoi ressemblera votre image affichÃ©e par un Minitel, avec une Ã©chelle de gris classique ou avec la vraie palette du Minitel. Le fichier VDT gÃ©nÃ©rÃ© par ImgToVdt devra enfin Ãªtre transfÃ©rÃ© sur Minitel. Une possibilitÃ© est dâutiliser: - le port sÃ©rie RS232 de votre Minitel - un cÃ¢ble "USB to Serial" Ã brancher sur une prise USB de votre PC - le port COM - la commande 'mode' dans l'Invite de commandes Windows. Ici vous trouverez davantage d'information Ã propos de comment transfÃ©rer votre fichier VDT vers le Minitel . En utilisant les caractÃ¨res de contrÃ´le on peut simuler le dÃ©placement de curseur. Ainsi il est possible dâafficher les caractÃ¨res dans un ordre diffÃ©rent, par exemple en lignes verticales comme dans âMatrixâ, ou en pixels alÃ©atoires!

Une chose que je n'arrive pas Ã comprendre c'est comment obtenir des images aussi "belles" que sur vos exemples en partant d'un jpg ou d'un png pourtant monochromes. J'arrive en tout cas Ã les afficher sur mon minitel, ce qui est dÃ©jÃ un exploit pour moi :D Bonjour ! Merci pour ce commentaire ! :) Et oui, c'est vrai que parfois quand on est trÃ¨s proche de l'Ã©cran l'image obtenue sur Minitel peut avoir l'air trÃ¨s pixelisÃ©e, mais je vous assure que les exemples que j'ai utilisÃ© sont vÃ©ridiques. Pour amÃ©liorer le rendu vous pouvez utiliser les options -v2 ou -v3 , et pour amÃ©liorer la luminositÃ© l'option -b ( La liste des options ) mais c'est vrai que certaines images se convertiront mieux que d'autres, en raison de l'approximation "curseur par curseur" du Minitel. Une autre possibilitÃ© serait de rogner l'image d'origine pour "zoomer" sur la partie la plus intÃ©ressante Ã convertir... Bonne continuation dans vos essais et merci encore ! Merci beaucoup, j'ai refais quelques tests ce matin en utilisant les options de rendus, mais Ã§a n'amÃ©liore pas vraiment mon image Ã la sortie. En tout cas c'est beaucoup moins beau que vos exemples ^^ J'ai lancÃ© un simple test avec le texte "Bonjour" en blanc sur fond noir en arial avec un fichier de 640x480 en jpeg avant conversion via ImgToVdt. RÃ©sultat le texte est illisible Ã la sortie tellement il est pixelisÃ©, alors que nous avions bien des textes relativement "grands" et lisibles sur minitel d'Ã©poque (certes je pars d'une image ici... mais quand mÃªme n'ayant que 2 couleurs sur mon image, je pensais que le rendu serait bien "tranchÃ©" sur les bords. Vous pensez qu'il serait possible de m'envoyer par exemple l'image du chat de votre dÃ©monstration pour que je puisse tester avec et voir si je me trompe quelque part ? Le but de ma dÃ©marche de base est juste d'afficher un logo en bicolore sur le minitel, mais lÃ mÃªme si le logo occupe l'ensemble de mon image de base, il est illisible au rendu minitel. En tout cas merci beaucoup pour ce logiciel trÃ¨s pratique et trÃ¨s bien fait ! Je ne suis pas sÃ»r d'avoir rÃ©ussi Ã retrouver l'image exacte du chat en question, mais voici quelques essais avec l'option -v2 Avec cette image j'obtiens cet aperÃ§u J'ai pu retrouver un autre vieux VDT de l'Ã©poque: https://anto80.com/images/CAT1.VDT , mais je ne suis pas sÃ»r d'avoir l'original. Autre exemple: avec cette image j'obtiens : ou ce VDT: https://anto80.com/images/GRUMPY.VDT Avec cette image j'obtiens : ou ce VDT: https://anto80.com/images/BONJOUR.VDT On voit que ce n'est pas simple mÃªme pour du bicolore... Avec cet autre type d'image (plus contrastÃ©e) j'obtiens ou ce VDT: https://anto80.com/images/HELLO.VDT En espÃ©rant qu'avec ces exemples vous arriverez aux rÃ©sultats souhaitÃ©s, bonne continuation ! Merci beaucoup pour votre implication dans la rÃ©ponse ! je vais tester tout cela de mon cÃ´tÃ© avec les transferts + envoies de vos VDT sur mon minitel ! Autre piste que j'envisageais c'Ã©tait de crÃ©er un fichier VDT Ã partir de 0, mais lÃ Ã§a mâÃ©tonnerait qu'un logiciel gÃ¨re encore ce format... Hi I'm having trouble running this, a terminal pops up and closes before I have a chance to do anything. I'm running on a windows 10 virtual machine. Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. ImageToMinitel (ImgToVdt) is indeed a Windows command-line utility, so on your virtual machine you'll have to open a Command prompt first. Here is the step by step how-to & troubleshooting https://anto80.com/en-us/image-processing/imgtovdt-image-convert-options-listopt... I hope it helps! I tried running it through troubleshooting steps and got the same problem. Using Command Prompt to open it resulted in the window opened then immediately closed again. This is strange. No new window should open when you enter imgtovdt in command prompt. Every action done by the software should also be displayed in the same command prompt window (and not a new window for example). Could you please capture a video of the commands you entered in the command prompt window? In which folder did you unzip the executable? Which native OS are you using? Thanks</TEXT>

This page needs to be updated… Can i test the game in a viedeo for free Hi, on the itch.io store page it states that this game is not available for Linux but you said it was ported to Ubuntu already and there is a SteamOS version available at Steam. I would prefer to buy this game on itch.io rather than another store. So will the Linux version be available on itch.io too? You would make at least one little penguin happy if you do ;) Greetings, Nishazzar Hey thanks for your post! We can take care of that soon for you hopefully if things work out as planned. We can have a look at possibly putting in the next update. Awesome! *readying my wallet to throw money at you* will this be coming to mac? Sorry about the lateness of my response but weare looking into it at the moment we have ported a version to Ubuntu so it shouldnt belong before mac porting Interesting gameplay mixed with tense moments - becomes frustrating at times, but only in the "trial-and-error-this-is-a-roguelike-suck-it-up" kinda way. Very satisfying to figure out the patterns and get away with all the loot ;) Great video! Just a heads up, we have updated quite a bit to include more tools, more NPCs, more AI behaviors, and Local Co-op. Hey! Thanks for watching and thanks for the heads up! I'll definitely check it out! :D Hello. I bought the game today. Meanwhile it's available in early access on steam i cannot download it from here. I wonder why. Sorry. I just should have been a little more patient. :) Hey no problem sorry about the delay So, mind telling us when the game will be downloadable? We apologize about the delay and we are actually waiting on steam so we can release the full game on both sites at the same time. Steam are having problems which is preventing the early access game to be uploaded. We apologize again and thank all of you for your patience. Gotcha. Thank you for the quick reply and for clearing it up. Not a problem. :-)</TEXT>

Imagine being the only survivor of an explosion that kills thousands of people. That is the fate of Sofya Rykov. And survival is just the beginning of her tale...

This installment serves as an introduction to players new to the series and provide important backstory to players who enjoyed Echoes of the Fey Episode 1: The Fox's Trail , already released on Steam.

An officer in the Imperial Army, Sofya is tasked with guarding Leshin prisoners at Onigrad, a city which will soon become famous for its fiery destruction. In the last days of the long war between Humans and Leshin, a tense stalemate emerges amidst the chaos. For years, Leshin have lain siege to the Humans over their use of Fey reactors, massive machines that draw electricity from the realm of magic. Both sides tire after almost thirty years of war, and perhaps peace is now in reach. But Leshin extremists, desperate for a victory to reclaim their power among the people, are about to stage a devastating attack that will change the world forever. Echoes of the Fey is a series of detective stories set in the high fantasy world of Oraz. Episode 0: The Immolation takes place before the protagonist, Sofya Rykov, becomes a private investigator. She is an officer in the Imperial Human army who believes she has secured a safe position as a prison guard in the metropolitan city of Onigrad. One fateful night, one of the Leshin assigned to her begins to act strangely. And then a massive boom rings out from the Onigrad Fey reactor... Episode 0 is an adventure game/visual novel with dialog trees and several choices for Sofya that will affect the way the story plays out. Sofya will also be able to explore the prison and learn more about the world from her prisoners, though with an impending disaster about to hit the prison, she will have to balance how to use her time before staging her escape.

<AUTHOR>Woodsy Studio</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://woodsy-studio.itch.io/echoes-of-the-fey-the-last-sacrament</URL>
<TEXT>
**FULL GAME NOW RELEASED!** The Echoes of the Fey series mixes a high fantasy setting with the mysteries and conspiracies of pulp detective fiction. Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she is the only Human able to wield unlimited magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot. Developed in Unreal Engine 4, The Last Sacrament forms the next installment of the ongoing series. Sofyaâs loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofyaâs childhood love and the Emperorâs daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerinaâs rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city—and Sofyaâs heart. Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofyaâs life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story. You can also pursue romances with four different characters in The Last Sacrament: Heremon, Arkady, Nikolai, or Katerina. -------------------------------------------------- Recommended MINIMUM requirements on LOW settings: Microsoft Windows 7 or higher AMD 7500 or NVIDIA GT 555M video card 4GB RAM Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz 2 GB free hard drive space

<TEXT>
Demo Content In this demo, youâll get a hands-on experience with the gameâs core mechanics, including the modular design of your units and their programmable functionality. The demo showcases the initial levels, featuring two maps and providing enough points to experiment with approximately ten modules and tactics. If you like the demo, don't forget to add the game to your Steam wishlist to stay updated on the full release! Gameplay Echoes of the Architects is a real-time strategy game that rewards creativity, strategic depth, and adaptability. Victory lies in your ability to design and deploy customizable, programmable units to dominate the battlefield. At its heart is a robust unit customization system, letting you build armies tailored to your playstyle. Combine modules like locomotion systems, weapons, and repair tools, and define your unitsâ roles—whether gathering resources, defending key points, or executing precision strikes to outflank enemies. Battles are fast-paced and dynamic, demanding sharp strategic thinking and quick adaptation. With programmable units capable of executing complex maneuvers autonomously, you can focus on your tactics rather than high actions-per-minute gameplay. As you advance, unlock new modules, unit classes, and tactical options, continuously evolving your forces. Explore diverse planets, each with unique environments and challenges, as you expand the fight across the galaxy. In Echoes of the Architects, every decision matters. Success depends on how you configure your army, time your deployments, and outmaneuver your opponents in the relentless chaos of war. Key Features Design with Precision : Craft modular, programmable units, each tailored to play a specific role in your customizable army. Shape your strategy, one unit at a time. Adapt Strategically : Analyze your opponent's strengths and weaknesses to deploy the perfect combination of units for any challenge. Flexibility is your greatest weapon. Deploy Tactically : Master the art of timing and positioning in dynamic skirmishes. Outsmart your enemies with clever builds and adaptable tactics. Dominate the Battlefield : Unlock powerful modules and advanced tactics to upgrade your army, overcoming tougher foes and securing victory through superior innovation. Asynchronous Multiplayer : Enjoy stress-free gameplay with pausable battles and unlimited, always-on replayability Story The galaxy was ours to conquer—or so we believed. In our unyielding quest for dominance, humanity delved too deeply into the void, awakening a force beyond comprehension: the Architects. Silent, enigmatic, and devastatingly efficient, they seized our greatest creations—turning humanityâs own advanced technologies into instruments of annihilation. Entire worlds fell in mere moments, their skies darkened by the machines we once called progress. Now, you stand as one of the last sparks of resistance, seeking shelter on a scarred and broken Earth—a planet consumed by the wars and greed of its past. With only the remnants of human ingenuity at your disposal, you command the battlefield from a distance, deploying whatâs left of our scattered forces. Every battle is a desperate gamble, a flicker of hope against the Architectsâ impenetrable grip. But thereâs something more—whispers buried deep in the ruins of our shattered worlds. Clues that hint at the true nature of the Architects, their purpose, and why they were waiting for us to awaken them. Understanding them might be the key to victory—or a revelation too dangerous to confront. This is our last chance to reclaim the galaxy, dismantle the Architectsâ empire, and unearth the secrets of their origin. The final war begins, and humanityâs fate rests in your hands.

<TEXT>
Echoes of the Future is an interactive fiction adventure written in Inform 6 using the PunyInform library, specially designed for 8-bit computers and retro systems such as the Commodore 64. Inspired by the classics of Infocom, this game invites you on a mysterious journey through time, with a slow-burning narrative that rewards curiosity, observation, and thoughtful reflection. In Echoes of the Future , the text is your map, and language is your tool. Reading carefully and thinking deeply are essential to progress. The story unfolds within an intimate and existential science fiction framework, structured in three chapters that gradually reveal unexpected connections between distant eras. The boundaries of time begin to blur, and what once seemed far away begins to echo within the present narrative. Available as a D64 image for Commodore 64 , ST disk image for Atari ST , DSK image for MSX, ZX Spectrum (CP/M required), and Amstrad CPC, floppy disk for MS-DOS , ADF disk image for Commodore Amiga , and now also as a GBA-compatible file for Game Boy Advance . A disk image for Acorn is also included (runs on the Acorn Ozmoo interpreter, currently in alpha) . You can run it on an emulator or transfer it to original hardware — simple instructions are included.  A version for Commander X16 is also available. The original Z-Machine .z5 file is also included, allowing the adventure to be played on any interpreter compatible with the Z-Machine format, such as Frotz (in the video, the adventure runs in Frotz on Linux inside a CoolRetroTerm terminal), Gargoyle, or Lectrote — making the story accessible on virtually any platform. Additionally, an HTML version is now available, so you can play the game instantly in your web browser without installing anything — just click and enjoy! The Official Solution is also available: Echoes of the Future: Chronicles of the Rebirth , now downloadable from the official section. Download it and dive into a story where time twists and every discovery echoes beyond its moment. Echoes of the Future is a journey that unfolds, word by word. Acknowledgements My heartfelt thanks to: Graham Nelson , for creating Inform 6 , the tool that made this adventure possible. Johan Berntsson and Fredrik Ramsberg , for their outstanding work on the PunyInform library, their invaluable technical support, and for developing the Ozmoo interpreter, which brings interactive fiction to life on classic systems like the Commodore 64. Shawn Sijnstra , for his excellent Vezza interpreter, enabling this story to run smoothly across a variety of retro platforms. Stefan Vogt , for his powerful Puny BuildTools , which greatly simplified the build and release process. Jade , for his dedication to testing, and for spotting the little things that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. And to everyone who, in one way or another, encouraged, helped, or inspired me throughout the development of Echoes of the Future . Thank you for believing in words, for traveling through time with me, and for keeping the magic of interactive fiction alive.

<TEXT>
Welcome to Echoes of the Broken — a tabletop roleplaying game of elemental mayhem in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Itâs been 100 years since the Breaking of the Gods, when the world of Ranaskar was devastated by an apocalyptic war between the gods. Falling from the heavens, the broken corpses of the gods became the Remnants — colossal, monolithic structures of arcane power. From the Remnants emanates the Echo, the will of the Broken Gods, twisted by their violent end. The Echo warps the land, and corrupts the people, leaving Ranaskar a volatile hellscape. Yet, some hope remains — Oros, the first to die. Numbered among the gods in a bygone era, Oros was betrayed and murdered by the other gods, their body torn asunder and scattered across the land. For thousands of years, the remains of Oros were dormant, mere curiosities to the mortals that lived their lives around them. Following the Breaking of the Gods, however, the Remnants of Oros came to life, projecting a warding shield to keep at bay the Echoes of the Broken Gods. Within these wards, the Sanctums of Oros, frightened mortals took refuge. Now, 100 years later, the Sanctums grow weak, ever besieged by the Echoes of the Broken Gods. In desperation, the Remnants of Oros have called upon champions — the Wardens. You are a Warden, plucked from the grasp of death and endowed with a fragment of Orosâs power, that you might stand against the Echoes of the Broken. Features An original system geared towards Narrative Agency, that keeps the fiction moving forward. An immersive character building experience. Worldbuilding tools to make each campaign of Echoes of the Broken your own. This game is in early access. While fully-playable, there is a lot more development and refinement to do.

<TEXT>
Two weeks ago the earth shifted outside a small town, slightly left of nowhere. It revealed the ruins of a forgotten city. People flocked to the ruins, eager to learn about the newly uncovered polis. Rumors flit about, that this could be a fabled city, thought by many to be nothing more than myth. Echoes of the Lost City is a game about two people - the CHRONICLER, a resident of the Lost City before its fall, who kept a record of their life and the goings on of their city, and the RESEARCHER hundreds of years in the future trying to uncover the truths about the Lost City through the Chroniclers' records. Together, players will label a dig site map and tell the story of the Lost City and its fall through the ancient accounts of the Chronicler and information found and interpreted by the Researcher. Played asynchronously between two people, Echoes of the Lost City is played by choosing locations on the dig site map and the CHRONICLER writing chronicle entries based in those locations. Then, the ravages of time will take effect on the chronicle and it is up to the RESEARCHER to decipher the information that has otherwise been lost to time. Will you be able to uncover the truth about the lost city? Or will it remain a myth forever? It is up to you. ****** If you enjoy this game, please tell me about it on Bluesky !

<TEXT>
ABOUT GAME 'Echoes of the dead' is a 2D roguelike platformer where players control Tanzo, a wizard on a quest for vengeance against the monsters that destroyed his village. The game features challenging projectile-based combat, requiring precision and strategy as Tanzo battles through hordes of enemies. Level is procedurally generated, ensuring a unique experience with every playthrough. As Tanzo delves deeper into the haunted landscapes, he faces increasingly powerful foes. DYNAMIC LEVEL DESIGN In 'Echoes of the dead' the level design revolves around procedural generation, ensuring that each playthrough offers a fresh and unpredictable experience. Every time a level restarts, either due to player death or level restarting, the environment completely changes—new enemy placements and layouts await. This dynamic design adds to the challenge, as no two runs are ever the same. If the player dies, they are sent back to the beginning, emphasizing the roguelike element and requiring them to master the game's mechanics and adapt to ever-changing levels. PROGRESSION To progress in 'Echoes of the dead' players must descend deeper into the game's treacherous levels, with the final boss waiting in the lowest floor. However, the deeper Tanzo goes, the tougher the enemies and challenges become. Itâs crucial to explore thoroughly, defeat enemies, and unlock all skills to strengthen Tanzo before facing the increasingly difficult foes that lurk in the depths. If you feel like you have lost your way, restart the level from pause menu.

For the best experience it's recommended to play the game  in headphones Controls Movement - WSAD Camera - Mouse Aim - Hold left mouse button Press Right mouse button to cancel aim Shoot - Release left mouse button Reload - R Tips Use your ammunition wisely; shooting should be a last resort. Sometimes, escape is your best form of defense. Look around carefully; danger will emerge from the fog. Lore Poland, Bieszczady Mountains, 2011. You are returning to your solitary cabin after an unsuccessful hunt. The old, wild mountains have tested you before, but this night was different. The silence was broken by terrifying human screams coming from the direction of the abandoned cemetery—a place that even locals gave a wide berth. Although common sense tells you to run, the knowledge that you have your reliable double-barreled shotgun slung over your shoulder breaks your internal resistance.

Basic Info Echoes Of The Past is a horror game in which you are a Paranormal investigator and you're trying to understand the story behind a lonely old mansion in the woods. New Update! The new Update has been now released! Have fun playing my game, remember, this is just a prototype, in future Updates the game might look different, stay tunned for more updates :) Patch Notes v0.0.2 #011723 -> Improved Post-Processing (WARNING! Do not play if your PC is not at least an average gaming PC, the game still doesn't have options so you can't turn the Post-Processing Off, that also means that some PC's might crash while playing); -> Improved performance : The v0.0.1 was a bit laggy because it was rendering all the grass in the world, now that does not happen anymore because I changed the way grass is rendered, this means that some PC's might have a little boost in performance; -> Improved Lightning : I changed some values in the game such as the fog and the flashlight so now the game looks much darker and better, it also helped doing the optimization for the grass; -> Improved grass : I changed the grass texture and now it looks more natural and blends in more with the rest of the forest, I will still try to make it better but I will probably just leave it like it is right now. -> More Trees : The v0.0.1 had 10000 Trees and now it has 25000, I know, Its a lot, and this was one of the worst but at the same time best ideas I've had, It ruins the game because now the game loads and renders 25000 trees but it also makes the game more realistic. Next Update Here is a list of what I will try to add to the game on v0.0.3 : -> Main Menu (Without Options Still, Options Maybe needs to be a single update, probably that's what coming on v0.0.4) -> Mansion Model on The map and also some other props I want to put in the forest -> Initial animation to explain the game's story

<URL>https://toribee.itch.io/echoes-of-the-labyrinth</URL>
<TEXT>
Concept : Echoes of the Labyrinth is a solo journaling TTRPG inspired by the novel " House of Leaves " by Mark Z. Danielewski using The Wretched game framework created by Chris Bissette. The player's character navigates an enigmatic, ever-changing house, attempting to understand its mystery, maintain sanity, and survive. Gameplay : The game is played with a deck of playing cards, a six-sided die, a Jenga tower, a journal, and tokens (scraps of paper) representing hope. The character's journey and experiences are documented through daily journal entries prompted by card draws. Prompt Tables : The game features four prompt tables themed after different elements: Architectural Changes, Unexplainable Phenomena, Psychological Struggles, and Discovery and Hope. Each card drawn corresponds to a specific prompt from these tables, creating unique, evolving gameplay. Endgame : The game ends when either the deck of cards is exhausted, indicating the character has survived and navigated the labyrinth for a considerable time, when the Jenga tower collapses, symbolizing a major catastrophe in the house, or when the player runs out of hope tokens, signifying complete hopelessness. Alternatively, the game can also end if the player finds an exit key and successfully escapes. Aim : The game's goal is not just survival but also crafting an engaging, immersive narrative about exploring the labyrinthine house and confronting its eerie phenomena and psychological challenges.

One world. Four ways to see it. Echoes of the Rift is an adventure across 4 genres. Uncover secrets as you journey to close the rift. Each of the 4 game-play styles hide clues to secrets found in the others. To find all the secrets and close the rift you must repeat the loop and look for hints. Game-play Styles Each style has you navigate the same world, interact with the same characters and complete the same interconnected quest. However, unique clues and secrets are hidden across the world. Characters will have different things to say, even on new loops of the same game-play style. Top Down - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Visual Novel - Controls with mouse,  WS or arrow keys, interact with E, shift or space bar. Platformer - Controls with AS or arrow keys, jump with W or up arrow key,  interact with E, shift or space bar. First Person - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, mouse to look around, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Echoes of the Rift was made in 4 days for the GMTK 25 Game Jam with the theme of "Loop". Why I decided to make 4 games instead of one nobody knows. Thanks for playing! You can find a video of me playing the game with commentary and revealing the locations of all the secrets here: Post-Jam Fixes Added music and sound effects Added return to menu button: Hold R for 3 seconds Fixed window scaling Fixed conditional dialogue, which was broken almost everywhere Rewrote most dialogue Made the action-y bits less fiddly Much more!

Echoes of the Past is a game made by 3  grade 7 students at Verdala International School in Malta. It was made for our IDU project in around 3-4 days. This game takes you to a future world, where you have to find remnants of Malta and watch the videos. The game has multiplayer, but it is not very good, as we were on a very tight deadline, although it should be functional. For some reason, the networking engine stopped working out of nowhere, but hopefully it works now. Screw you PUN2. Feel free to download and try our game out!

Dive into this apparently infinite dungeon, where there's no sign of external light and there are many things lurking in the shadows. Your lantern has the power of focusing light into a concentrated path, raising the temperature of everything it touches! Entry participation for Brackey's community 2023.2 Game Jam on August 2023. The theme was "Diving deeper" and even though that theme probably reminds you more of a subaquatic kind of game, I thought I could give it a spin by making it symbolize "diving"  into the darkness and "deeper" into an infinite dungeon. I had more ideas to better utilize the theme but they were scrapped due to the time limit (Game jam was 1 week). Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated!

Imagine being the only survivor of an explosion that kills thousands of people. That is the fate of Sofya Rykov. And survival is just the beginning of her tale...

In the last days of the long war between Humans and Leshin, a tense stalemate emerges amidst the chaos. For years, Leshin have lain siege to the Humans over their use of Fey reactors, massive machines that draw electricity from the realm of magic. Both sides tire after almost thirty years of war, and perhaps peace is now in reach. But Leshin extremists, desperate for a victory to reclaim their power among the people, are about to stage a devastating attack that will change the world forever. Echoes of the Fey is a series of detective stories set in the high fantasy world of Oraz. Episode 0: The Immolation takes place before the protagonist, Sofya Rykov, becomes a private investigator. She is an officer in the Imperial Human army who believes she has secured a safe position as a prison guard in the metropolitan city of Onigrad. One fateful night, one of the Leshin assigned to her begins to act strangely. And then a massive boom rings out from the Onigrad Fey reactor... Episode 0 is an adventure game/visual novel with dialog trees and several choices for Sofya that will affect the way the story plays out.

**FULL GAME NOW RELEASED!** The Echoes of the Fey series mixes a high fantasy setting with the mysteries and conspiracies of pulp detective fiction. Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she is the only Human able to wield unlimited magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot. Developed in Unreal Engine 4, The Last Sacrament forms the next installment of the ongoing series. Sofyaâs loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofyaâs childhood love and the Emperorâs daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerinaâs rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city—and Sofyaâs heart. Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofyaâs life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story. You can also pursue romances with four different characters in The Last Sacrament: Heremon, Arkady, Nikolai, or Katerina. -------------------------------------------------- Recommended MINIMUM requirements on LOW settings: Microsoft Windows 7 or higher AMD 7500 or NVIDIA GT 555M video card 4GB RAM Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz 2 GB free hard drive space

The demo showcases the initial levels, featuring two maps and providing enough points to experiment with approximately ten modules and tactics. If you like the demo, don't forget to add the game to your Steam wishlist to stay updated on the full release! Gameplay Echoes of the Architects is a real-time strategy game that rewards creativity, strategic depth, and adaptability. Victory lies in your ability to design and deploy customizable, programmable units to dominate the battlefield. At its heart is a robust unit customization system, letting you build armies tailored to your playstyle. Combine modules like locomotion systems, weapons, and repair tools, and define your unitsâ roles—whether gathering resources, defending key points, or executing precision strikes to outflank enemies. Battles are fast-paced and dynamic, demanding sharp strategic thinking and quick adaptation. With programmable units capable of executing complex maneuvers autonomously, you can focus on your tactics rather than high actions-per-minute gameplay. As you advance, unlock new modules, unit classes, and tactical options, continuously evolving your forces. Explore diverse planets, each with unique environments and challenges, as you expand the fight across the galaxy. In Echoes of the Architects, every decision matters. Success depends on how you configure your army, time your deployments, and outmaneuver your opponents in the relentless chaos of war. Key Features Design with Precision : Craft modular, programmable units, each tailored to play a specific role in your customizable army. Shape your strategy, one unit at a time. Adapt Strategically : Analyze your opponent's strengths and weaknesses to deploy the perfect combination of units for any challenge. Flexibility is your greatest weapon. Deploy Tactically : Master the art of timing and positioning in dynamic skirmishes. Outsmart your enemies with clever builds and adaptable tactics. Dominate the Battlefield : Unlock powerful modules and advanced tactics to upgrade your army, overcoming tougher foes and securing victory through superior innovation. Asynchronous Multiplayer : Enjoy stress-free gameplay with pausable battles and unlimited, always-on replayability Story The galaxy was ours to conquer—or so we believed. In our unyielding quest for dominance, humanity delved too deeply into the void, awakening a force beyond comprehension: the Architects. Silent, enigmatic, and devastatingly efficient, they seized our greatest creations—turning humanityâs own advanced technologies into instruments of annihilation. Entire worlds fell in mere moments, their skies darkened by the machines we once called progress. Now, you stand as one of the last sparks of resistance, seeking shelter on a scarred and broken Earth—a planet consumed by the wars and greed of its past. With only the remnants of human ingenuity at your disposal, you command the battlefield from a distance, deploying whatâs left of our scattered forces. Every battle is a desperate gamble, a flicker of hope against the Architectsâ impenetrable grip. But thereâs something more—whispers buried deep in the ruins of our shattered worlds. Clues that hint at the true nature of the Architects, their purpose, and why they were waiting for us to awaken them. Understanding them might be the key to victory—or a revelation too dangerous to confront. This is our last chance to reclaim the galaxy, dismantle the Architectsâ empire, and unearth the secrets of their origin. The final war begins, and humanityâs fate rests in your hands.

<TEXT>
Echoes of the Future is an interactive fiction adventure written in Inform 6 using the PunyInform library, specially designed for 8-bit computers and retro systems such as the Commodore 64. Inspired by the classics of Infocom, this game invites you on a mysterious journey through time, with a slow-burning narrative that rewards curiosity, observation, and thoughtful reflection. In Echoes of the Future , the text is your map, and language is your tool. Reading carefully and thinking deeply are essential to progress. The story unfolds within an intimate and existential science fiction framework, structured in three chapters that gradually reveal unexpected connections between distant eras. The boundaries of time begin to blur, and what once seemed far away begins to echo within the present narrative. Available as a D64 image for Commodore 64 , ST disk image for Atari ST , DSK image for MSX, ZX Spectrum (CP/M required), and Amstrad CPC, floppy disk for MS-DOS , ADF disk image for Commodore Amiga , and now also as a GBA-compatible file for Game Boy Advance . A disk image for Acorn is also included (runs on the Acorn Ozmoo interpreter, currently in alpha) . You can run it on an emulator or transfer it to original hardware — simple instructions are included.  A version for Commander X16 is also available. The original Z-Machine .z5 file is also included, allowing the adventure to be played on any interpreter compatible with the Z-Machine format, such as Frotz (in the video, the adventure runs in Frotz on Linux inside a CoolRetroTerm terminal), Gargoyle, or Lectrote — making the story accessible on virtually any platform. Additionally, an HTML version is now available, so you can play the game instantly in your web browser without installing anything — just click and enjoy! The Official Solution is also available: Echoes of the Future: Chronicles of the Rebirth , now downloadable from the official section. Download it and dive into a story where time twists and every discovery echoes beyond its moment. Echoes of the Future is a journey that unfolds, word by word. Acknowledgements My heartfelt thanks to: Graham Nelson , for creating Inform 6 , the tool that made this adventure possible. Johan Berntsson and Fredrik Ramsberg , for their outstanding work on the PunyInform library, their invaluable technical support, and for developing the Ozmoo interpreter, which brings interactive fiction to life on classic systems like the Commodore 64. Shawn Sijnstra , for his excellent Vezza interpreter, enabling this story to run smoothly across a variety of retro platforms. Stefan Vogt , for his powerful Puny BuildTools , which greatly simplified the build and release process. Jade , for his dedication to testing, and for spotting the little things that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. And to everyone who, in one way or another, encouraged, helped, or inspired me throughout the development of Echoes of the Future . Thank you for believing in words, for traveling through time with me, and for keeping the magic of interactive fiction alive.

<TEXT>
Welcome to Echoes of the Broken — a tabletop roleplaying game of elemental mayhem in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Itâs been 100 years since the Breaking of the Gods, when the world of Ranaskar was devastated by an apocalyptic war between the gods. Falling from the heavens, the broken corpses of the gods became the Remnants — colossal, monolithic structures of arcane power. From the Remnants emanates the Echo, the will of the Broken Gods, twisted by their violent end. The Echo warps the land, and corrupts the people, leaving Ranaskar a volatile hellscape. Yet, some hope remains — Oros, the first to die. Numbered among the gods in a bygone era, Oros was betrayed and murdered by the other gods, their body torn asunder and scattered across the land. For thousands of years, the remains of Oros were dormant, mere curiosities to the mortals that lived their lives around them. Following the Breaking of the Gods, however, the Remnants of Oros came to life, projecting a warding shield to keep at bay the Echoes of the Broken Gods. Within these wards, the Sanctums of Oros, frightened mortals took refuge. Now, 100 years later, the Sanctums grow weak, ever besieged by the Echoes of the Broken Gods. In desperation, the Remnants of Oros have called upon champions — the Wardens. You are a Warden, plucked from the grasp of death and endowed with a fragment of Orosâs power, that you might stand against the Echoes of the Broken. Features An original system geared towards Narrative Agency, that keeps the fiction moving forward. An immersive character building experience. Worldbuilding tools to make each campaign of Echoes of the Broken your own. This game is in early access. While fully-playable, there is a lot more development and refinement to do.

<TEXT>
Two weeks ago the earth shifted outside a small town, slightly left of nowhere. It revealed the ruins of a forgotten city. People flocked to the ruins, eager to learn about the newly uncovered polis. Rumors flit about, that this could be a fabled city, thought by many to be nothing more than myth. Echoes of the Lost City is a game about two people - the CHRONICLER, a resident of the Lost City before its fall, who kept a record of their life and the goings on of their city, and the RESEARCHER hundreds of years in the future trying to uncover the truths about the Lost City through the Chroniclers' records. Together, players will label a dig site map and tell the story of the Lost City and its fall through the ancient accounts of the Chronicler and information found and interpreted by the Researcher. Played asynchronously between two people, Echoes of the Lost City is played by choosing locations on the dig site map and the CHRONICLER writing chronicle entries based in those locations. Then, the ravages of time will take effect on the chronicle and it is up to the RESEARCHER to decipher the information that has otherwise been lost to time. Will you be able to uncover the truth about the lost city? Or will it remain a myth forever? It is up to you. ****** If you enjoy this game, please tell me about it on Bluesky !

<TEXT>
ABOUT GAME 'Echoes of the dead' is a 2D roguelike platformer where players control Tanzo, a wizard on a quest for vengeance against the monsters that destroyed his village. The game features challenging projectile-based combat, requiring precision and strategy as Tanzo battles through hordes of enemies. Level is procedurally generated, ensuring a unique experience with every playthrough. As Tanzo delves deeper into the haunted landscapes, he faces increasingly powerful foes. DYNAMIC LEVEL DESIGN In 'Echoes of the dead' the level design revolves around procedural generation, ensuring that each playthrough offers a fresh and unpredictable experience. Every time a level restarts, either due to player death or level restarting, the environment completely changes—new enemy placements and layouts await. This dynamic design adds to the challenge, as no two runs are ever the same. If the player dies, they are sent back to the beginning, emphasizing the roguelike element and requiring them to master the game's mechanics and adapt to ever-changing levels. PROGRESSION To progress in 'Echoes of the dead' players must descend deeper into the game's treacherous levels, with the final boss waiting in the lowest floor. However, the deeper Tanzo goes, the tougher the enemies and challenges become. Itâs crucial to explore thoroughly, defeat enemies, and unlock all skills to strengthen Tanzo before facing the increasingly difficult foes that lurk in the depths. If you feel like you have lost your way, restart the level from pause menu.

For the best experience it's recommended to play the game  in headphones Controls Movement - WSAD Camera - Mouse Aim - Hold left mouse button Press Right mouse button to cancel aim Shoot - Release left mouse button Reload - R Tips Use your ammunition wisely; shooting should be a last resort. Sometimes, escape is your best form of defense. Look around carefully; danger will emerge from the fog. Lore Poland, Bieszczady Mountains, 2011. You are returning to your solitary cabin after an unsuccessful hunt. The old, wild mountains have tested you before, but this night was different. The silence was broken by terrifying human screams coming from the direction of the abandoned cemetery—a place that even locals gave a wide berth. Although common sense tells you to run, the knowledge that you have your reliable double-barreled shotgun slung over your shoulder breaks your internal resistance.

Basic Info Echoes Of The Past is a horror game in which you are a Paranormal investigator and you're trying to understand the story behind a lonely old mansion in the woods. New Update! The new Update has been now released! Have fun playing my game, remember, this is just a prototype, in future Updates the game might look different, stay tunned for more updates :) Patch Notes v0.0.2 #011723 -> Improved Post-Processing (WARNING! Do not play if your PC is not at least an average gaming PC, the game still doesn't have options so you can't turn the Post-Processing Off, that also means that some PC's might crash while playing); -> Improved performance : The v0.0.1 was a bit laggy because it was rendering all the grass in the world, now that does not happen anymore because I changed the way grass is rendered, this means that some PC's might have a little boost in performance; -> Improved Lightning : I changed some values in the game such as the fog and the flashlight so now the game looks much darker and better, it also helped doing the optimization for the grass; -> Improved grass : I changed the grass texture and now it looks more natural and blends in more with the rest of the forest, I will still try to make it better but I will probably just leave it like it is right now. -> More Trees : The v0.0.1 had 10000 Trees and now it has 25000, I know, Its a lot, and this was one of the worst but at the same time best ideas I've had, It ruins the game because now the game loads and renders 25000 trees but it also makes the game more realistic. Next Update Here is a list of what I will try to add to the game on v0.0.3 : -> Main Menu (Without Options Still, Options Maybe needs to be a single update, probably that's what coming on v0.0.4) -> Mansion Model on The map and also some other props I want to put in the forest -> Initial animation to explain the game's story

<TITLE>Echoes of the Labyrinth</TITLE>

<URL>https://toribee.itch.io/echoes-of-the-labyrinth</URL>
<TEXT>
Concept : Echoes of the Labyrinth is a solo journaling TTRPG inspired by the novel " House of Leaves " by Mark Z. Danielewski using The Wretched game framework created by Chris Bissette. The player's character navigates an enigmatic, ever-changing house, attempting to understand its mystery, maintain sanity, and survive. Gameplay : The game is played with a deck of playing cards, a six-sided die, a Jenga tower, a journal, and tokens (scraps of paper) representing hope. The character's journey and experiences are documented through daily journal entries prompted by card draws. Prompt Tables : The game features four prompt tables themed after different elements: Architectural Changes, Unexplainable Phenomena, Psychological Struggles, and Discovery and Hope. Each card drawn corresponds to a specific prompt from these tables, creating unique, evolving gameplay. Endgame : The game ends when either the deck of cards is exhausted, indicating the character has survived and navigated the labyrinth for a considerable time, when the Jenga tower collapses, symbolizing a major catastrophe in the house, or when the player runs out of hope tokens, signifying complete hopelessness. Alternatively, the game can also end if the player finds an exit key and successfully escapes. Aim : The game's goal is not just survival but also crafting an engaging, immersive narrative about exploring the labyrinthine house and confronting its eerie phenomena and psychological challenges.

One world. Four ways to see it. Echoes of the Rift is an adventure across 4 genres. Uncover secrets as you journey to close the rift. Each of the 4 game-play styles hide clues to secrets found in the others. To find all the secrets and close the rift you must repeat the loop and look for hints. Game-play Styles Each style has you navigate the same world, interact with the same characters and complete the same interconnected quest. However, unique clues and secrets are hidden across the world. Characters will have different things to say, even on new loops of the same game-play style. Top Down - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Visual Novel - Controls with mouse,  WS or arrow keys, interact with E, shift or space bar. Platformer - Controls with AS or arrow keys, jump with W or up arrow key,  interact with E, shift or space bar. First Person - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, mouse to look around, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Echoes of the Rift was made in 4 days for the GMTK 25 Game Jam with the theme of "Loop". Why I decided to make 4 games instead of one nobody knows. Thanks for playing! You can find a video of me playing the game with commentary and revealing the locations of all the secrets here: Post-Jam Fixes Added music and sound effects Added return to menu button: Hold R for 3 seconds Fixed window scaling Fixed conditional dialogue, which was broken almost everywhere Rewrote most dialogue Made the action-y bits less fiddly Much more!

Echoes of the Past is a game made by 3  grade 7 students at Verdala International School in Malta. It was made for our IDU project in around 3-4 days. This game takes you to a future world, where you have to find remnants of Malta and watch the videos. The game has multiplayer, but it is not very good, as we were on a very tight deadline, although it should be functional. For some reason, the networking engine stopped working out of nowhere, but hopefully it works now. Screw you PUN2. Feel free to download and try our game out!

Dive into this apparently infinite dungeon, where there's no sign of external light and there are many things lurking in the shadows. Your lantern has the power of focusing light into a concentrated path, raising the temperature of everything it touches! Entry participation for Brackey's community 2023.2 Game Jam on August 2023. The theme was "Diving deeper" and even though that theme probably reminds you more of a subaquatic kind of game, I thought I could give it a spin by making it symbolize "diving"  into the darkness and "deeper" into an infinite dungeon. I had more ideas to better utilize the theme but they were scrapped due to the time limit (Game jam was 1 week). Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated!

âIf the walls could talk,â they said. But you know better. In the late hours, during the absolute darkness, the walls will open their maws and whisper their secrets, shared through cries and wails and mimicry of the horrors within. Youâre a private investigator with the unique talent of teasing out their mysteries and piecing together their meanings. This is a solo journaling RPG about the knowledge of the walls. You play it by yourself in the dark. As you draw cards, youâll be directed to prompts to write as the P.I. trying to solve a mystery. Throughout the game, youâll draw cards from your constructed Whispers Deck to learn what the walls, ceiling and floors are telling or showing you, keep notes on what you think it all means and ultimately conclude the truth. A session takes between 15 and 60 minutes and is highly replayable. Each session is unique.

Whispers in the Walls is a horror game with a deeper meaning. As the game progresses, the player will play through surreal experiences. More supernatural things start occurring, and the player will feel creeped out by it, while getting intrigued by what is actually going on. In actuality, this is a game made to complement a campaign that raises awareness about Alzheimer's disease. This was a cause close to our hearts, as some of us have loved ones affected by it. I was in charge of developing an incredible concept that captures the daily struggles of those living with the illness, conveying their feelings of confusion, loneliness, and frustration. We wanted the game to feel creepy, but not quite horror yet. I have written the main story, a lot of the dialogue, and I have also been the voice actor for every major role. This project was a deeply meaningful experience, allowing us to merge creativity with purpose and use game design as a tool for awareness and empathy. This game was created in three weeks.

Whispers In The Pines was made in three days! It was created in a youtube video that you can watch here: Watch me making it I challenged myself to make a horror game without coding! This is the download page for it! It is not much but I think you might enjoy it for a short gaming experience. Average playtime : 10-15 minutes This game itself was more of a challenge to see what I could do in a short period of time. I hope you guys enjoy the little game that this is! This game is not finished. This game was made in three days! It could have bugs, issues, and the game length is around 10-15 minutes. Please have fun with it! Mac and Linux versions have not been tested. Any and all feedback would be fantastic. All questions and problems can be reported in the comments. Links: YouTube Website

IMPORTANT! For the version downloaded from Itch.io, it is strongly recommended to add the game folder to the exceptions list of Windows Defender and other antivirus software. The game is available on Steam and GOG too. *** â'Whispers in the Moss' is a stunning tribute to the retros, a modern testament to the timeless allure of vintage gaming, and above all, a clear demonstration that the essence of passion-driven indie gaming is still very much alive and well.â RPG Gamers âWhispers in the Moss is a genuine joy to play for a retro enthusiast with a penchant for old-school RPGs. It is both steeping in gaming history and modern enough to be enjoyable without taking a 12-week correspondence course first.â 8.0 â Gaming Respawn âThen, like in The Matrix, shapes become familiar in the code: crackling fireplaces, wooden bridges across thin streams, crops in sprawling fields, and thick mountain ranges. ... Whispers in the Moss is one of the most unique games Iâve had the pleasure to try in the last twenty years.â 8/9 â Ladies Gamers *** WHISPERS IN THE MOSS is a full-scale retro JRPG experience that embraces the nostalgic charm of 8-bit and 16-bit console classics, especially those from the early SquareSoft era. Embark on an epic journey with three young heroes from a tranquil fishing village, thrust into a world dominated by an empire seeking ultimate power and a banished prince determined to restore balance. As they traverse the world, our party uncovers an even more sinister secret—fiends of the underworld are stirring... An Epic Story: Prepare for emotional plot twists, lighthearted humor, and vibrant characters. Classic Turn-Based Battles: Inspired by the early Final Fantasy games, strategically exploit your enemies' weaknesses using physical attacks, black and white magic, items, and special skills. Witness your characters' growth and customize their abilities. A Highly Unique Visual Style: The game boasts beautiful and ambitious textmode (ANSI-style) graphics, offering an unparalleled retro atmosphere. This innovative use of text-based graphics on such a scale and level of ambition is a first in gaming. Whatâs more, "Whispers in the Moss" is coded entirely in QB64, a modern take on the legendary QuickBASIC programming language, completing the genuine retro experience. Original Custom Soundtrack: Immerse yourself in the game's world with sound effects and a full original soundtrack featuring over 50 unique tracks, composed by the game's developer, Tapio of Uncultured Games. Drawing inspiration from JRPG music legends like Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Michiru Oshima, the music brings the world of the game to life. Abundance of Optional Content: In addition to the main story, explore a vast array of side quests, monster hunts, fishing and other mini-games, and other hidden secrets. Can you locate and conquer all the ~170 unique monsters and complete the bestiary? Retro Gaming for Modern Systems: "Whispers in the Moss" was released on May 31, 2024, and it is available on Itch.io, Steam, and GOG. A Decade in the Making: This artisanal game is the sole creation of Tapio from Uncultured Games, a Finnish game development studio. Single-handedly, he has managed the coding, game engine, art, script, soundtrack, and even crafted these god-forsaken marketing texts. Over the course of well over 13 years of development, Tapio, a father of two and a marketing professional by day, has remained a dedicated hobbyist game developer by night. Update Patch Notes (Latest update 1.15 was released on July 24, 2024) 1.1 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Quick Save: Added a 'Quick Save' feature when stepping on a Save Crystal. Will save on slot #1. Quit to Desktop: Added a 'Quit to Desktop' option in the game menu. Bestiary Access: You can now view the bestiary in-game by pressing ENTER when the 'Hunts' tab is open in the menu. Venom Balance: Made Rosemary items much cheaper to balance the venom status effect. Venom Bug Fix: Character's HP amount in the menu will now update as a character takes field venom damage (the bug prevented the menu from updating, and you couldn't see the damage taken). Item Shop: When browsing for items in an item shop, you can now see the equipped status of jewel-type items. Improved Interactions: Increased the interaction/activation area for various places and objects. Fishing Minigame: Some balance and bug fixes applied to the fishing minigame. Capture Skill: Adjusted the success rate for Veda's 'Capture' skill. Steal Skill: Adjusted the success rate for Orion's 'Steal' skill. Bug Fixes: Numerous other small bug fixes implemented. Dialogue Fixes: Numerous small dialogue adjustments made. Balance Tweaks: Numerous small balance adjustments made. 1.15 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Increased success rate for Veda's Capture skill. Increased success rate for Orion's Steal skill. Slightly increased gold accumulation from battles, stealing, and chests. Increased likelihood of encountering rare fish in the fishing mini-game. Adjusted stats and attacks of certain enemies. Fixed bestiary index number bug (index number shown at the end of battle now matches the number in the bestiary). Various text and script fixes. Fixed warp bugs on a few maps. Fixed a critical endgame bug that occasionally caused the game to identify regular battles as specific boss battles. Added support for the A/D keys during battles, allowing players to browse skills in both directions (can be used instead of TAB). Numerous smaller fixes.

In the heart of an ancient, abandoned mansion, your character awakens to the chilling realization that they are trapped in a dark room. The air is heavy with the stench of decay, and an unsettling silence hangs in the darkness. A single lantern in their hand casting eerie shadows that dance along the cold walls. They realize they were locked in by a mysterious monster. Armed only with the flickering lantern, they have to discover five cryptic papers with numbers of a code and clues leading to the next location of the next paper. As your character unravels the mysteries of the mansion, piecing together the digits, they approach the exit. The shadows come alive, but the monster seems to be an observer rather than an obstacle. Armed only with the lantern, your character faces the final challenge against the vengeful spirits guarding their escape- the secret code. In this last struggle, they must navigate the haunted room's depths, avoiding entities drawn to the lantern's feeble light. Succeeding means breaking free from the room's clutches, with the monster watching from the shadows. Failure would mean becoming another whisper in the haunted halls. The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival and spectral intrigue. Will your character escape the haunted mansion, or become another lost soul swallowed by the shadows? The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival.

You accidentally fell into another dimension, witnessing something that once happened, or is still happening, in that space. What happened to the new transfer student? Why are the students in the class disappearing one by one? Could the teacher's indifference also be a form of guilt? A story about school violence. While I think explaining a story can sometimes feel unnecessary, Iâll give it a try... In this game, the player takes on the role of a teacher who enters a school and begins to experience the life of a new transfer student. The teacher/player witnesses the whispers,   mocking and bullying directed at the student. As the teacher enters the classroom, he begins to relive his own actions towards his students. He remembers how he would casually inquire about their well-being but never truly cared to understand what was really happening to the transfer student—or to any of his students. Throughout the game, the player's identity shifts several times. They embody the transfer student, the teacher, and another bullied student who interacts with the transfer student(in the locker). In the later act, the transfer student realize just hiding would not stop other students from bullying, he begins to seek revenge, and the teacher/player is left as the last one standing. The ending leaves it to the player's imagination to consider what fate might await him. I realize this might be a bit hard to follow, but I'll try something less complex next time... maybe. shorts: playthrough: ( hiding place is at 01:30)

âIf the walls could talk,â they said. But you know better. In the late hours, during the absolute darkness, the walls will open their maws and whisper their secrets, shared through cries and wails and mimicry of the horrors within. Youâre a private investigator with the unique talent of teasing out their mysteries and piecing together their meanings. This is a solo journaling RPG about the knowledge of the walls. You play it by yourself in the dark. As you draw cards, youâll be directed to prompts to write as the P.I. trying to solve a mystery.

Whispers in the Walls is a horror game with a deeper meaning. As the game progresses, the player will play through surreal experiences. More supernatural things start occurring, and the player will feel creeped out by it, while getting intrigued by what is actually going on. In actuality, this is a game made to complement a campaign that raises awareness about Alzheimer's disease. This was a cause close to our hearts, as some of us have loved ones affected by it. I was in charge of developing an incredible concept that captures the daily struggles of those living with the illness, conveying their feelings of confusion, loneliness, and frustration. We wanted the game to feel creepy, but not quite horror yet. I have written the main story, a lot of the dialogue, and I have also been the voice actor for every major role. This project was a deeply meaningful experience, allowing us to merge creativity with purpose and use game design as a tool for awareness and empathy. This game was created in three weeks.

IMPORTANT! For the version downloaded from Itch.io, it is strongly recommended to add the game folder to the exceptions list of Windows Defender and other antivirus software. The game is available on Steam and GOG too. *** â'Whispers in the Moss' is a stunning tribute to the retros, a modern testament to the timeless allure of vintage gaming, and above all, a clear demonstration that the essence of passion-driven indie gaming is still very much alive and well.â RPG Gamers âWhispers in the Moss is a genuine joy to play for a retro enthusiast with a penchant for old-school RPGs. It is both steeping in gaming history and modern enough to be enjoyable without taking a 12-week correspondence course first.â 8.0 â Gaming Respawn âThen, like in The Matrix, shapes become familiar in the code: crackling fireplaces, wooden bridges across thin streams, crops in sprawling fields, and thick mountain ranges. ... Whispers in the Moss is one of the most unique games Iâve had the pleasure to try in the last twenty years.â 8/9 â Ladies Gamers *** WHISPERS IN THE MOSS is a full-scale retro JRPG experience that embraces the nostalgic charm of 8-bit and 16-bit console classics, especially those from the early SquareSoft era. Embark on an epic journey with three young heroes from a tranquil fishing village, thrust into a world dominated by an empire seeking ultimate power and a banished prince determined to restore balance. As they traverse the world, our party uncovers an even more sinister secret—fiends of the underworld are stirring... An Epic Story: Prepare for emotional plot twists, lighthearted humor, and vibrant characters. Classic Turn-Based Battles: Inspired by the early Final Fantasy games, strategically exploit your enemies' weaknesses using physical attacks, black and white magic, items, and special skills. Witness your characters' growth and customize their abilities. A Highly Unique Visual Style: The game boasts beautiful and ambitious textmode (ANSI-style) graphics, offering an unparalleled retro atmosphere. This innovative use of text-based graphics on such a scale and level of ambition is a first in gaming. Whatâs more, "Whispers in the Moss" is coded entirely in QB64, a modern take on the legendary QuickBASIC programming language, completing the genuine retro experience. Original Custom Soundtrack: Immerse yourself in the game's world with sound effects and a full original soundtrack featuring over 50 unique tracks, composed by the game's developer, Tapio of Uncultured Games. Drawing inspiration from JRPG music legends like Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Michiru Oshima, the music brings the world of the game to life. Abundance of Optional Content: In addition to the main story, explore a vast array of side quests, monster hunts, fishing and other mini-games, and other hidden secrets. Can you locate and conquer all the ~170 unique monsters and complete the bestiary? Retro Gaming for Modern Systems: "Whispers in the Moss" was released on May 31, 2024, and it is available on Itch.io, Steam, and GOG. A Decade in the Making: This artisanal game is the sole creation of Tapio from Uncultured Games, a Finnish game development studio. Single-handedly, he has managed the coding, game engine, art, script, soundtrack, and even crafted these god-forsaken marketing texts. Over the course of well over 13 years of development, Tapio, a father of two and a marketing professional by day, has remained a dedicated hobbyist game developer by night. Update Patch Notes (Latest update 1.15 was released on July 24, 2024) 1.1 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Quick Save: Added a 'Quick Save' feature when stepping on a Save Crystal. Will save on slot #1. Quit to Desktop: Added a 'Quit to Desktop' option in the game menu. Bestiary Access: You can now view the bestiary in-game by pressing ENTER when the 'Hunts' tab is open in the menu. Venom Balance: Made Rosemary items much cheaper to balance the venom status effect. Venom Bug Fix: Character's HP amount in the menu will now update as a character takes field venom damage (the bug prevented the menu from updating, and you couldn't see the damage taken). Item Shop: When browsing for items in an item shop, you can now see the equipped status of jewel-type items. Improved Interactions: Increased the interaction/activation area for various places and objects. Fishing Minigame: Some balance and bug fixes applied to the fishing minigame. Capture Skill: Adjusted the success rate for Veda's 'Capture' skill. Steal Skill: Adjusted the success rate for Orion's 'Steal' skill. Bug Fixes: Numerous other small bug fixes implemented. Dialogue Fixes: Numerous small dialogue adjustments made. Balance Tweaks: Numerous small balance adjustments made. 1.15 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Increased success rate for Veda's Capture skill. Increased success rate for Orion's Steal skill. Slightly increased gold accumulation from battles, stealing, and chests. Increased likelihood of encountering rare fish in the fishing mini-game. Adjusted stats and attacks of certain enemies. Fixed bestiary index number bug (index number shown at the end of battle now matches the number in the bestiary). Various text and script fixes. Fixed warp bugs on a few maps. Fixed a critical endgame bug that occasionally caused the game to identify regular battles as specific boss battles. Added support for the A/D keys during battles, allowing players to browse skills in both directions (can be used instead of TAB). Numerous smaller fixes.

In the heart of an ancient, abandoned mansion, your character awakens to the chilling realization that they are trapped in a dark room. The air is heavy with the stench of decay, and an unsettling silence hangs in the darkness. A single lantern in their hand casting eerie shadows that dance along the cold walls. They realize they were locked in by a mysterious monster. Armed only with the flickering lantern, they have to discover five cryptic papers with numbers of a code and clues leading to the next location of the next paper. As your character unravels the mysteries of the mansion, piecing together the digits, they approach the exit. The shadows come alive, but the monster seems to be an observer rather than an obstacle. Armed only with the lantern, your character faces the final challenge against the vengeful spirits guarding their escape- the secret code. In this last struggle, they must navigate the haunted room's depths, avoiding entities drawn to the lantern's feeble light. Succeeding means breaking free from the room's clutches, with the monster watching from the shadows. Failure would mean becoming another whisper in the haunted halls. The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival and spectral intrigue. Will your character escape the haunted mansion, or become another lost soul swallowed by the shadows? The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival.

Players explore a haunted mine and must uncover the reasons behind the spirits' unrest. This is intended to be an introductory adventure for D6 Dungeons, which you can find here: https://gunsngrenades.itch.io/d6-dungeons . It can also be used with most other systems with a little tweaking and conversion. This is my first time writing an adventure like this, so if anyone knows how to improve it, let me know.

Whispers in the Shadows is a game made for the UDC Jam #28 In the game, you are an explorer desperately trying to save the forest from the shadows that currently haunt it. The only way to do so is to find all 3 of the gems hidden in the forest and restore their place in the Shrine. The task you are about to undergo isn't going to be an easy one, as the Shadows that currently live in the forest will try to stop you. Although they may be blind, they can still hear you, so be as silent as you can while traversing through the woods.

You accidentally fell into another dimension, witnessing something that once happened, or is still happening, in that space. What happened to the new transfer student? Why are the students in the class disappearing one by one? Could the teacher's indifference also be a form of guilt? A story about school violence. While I think explaining a story can sometimes feel unnecessary, Iâll give it a try... In this game, the player takes on the role of a teacher who enters a school and begins to experience the life of a new transfer student. The teacher/player witnesses the whispers,   mocking and bullying directed at the student. As the teacher enters the classroom, he begins to relive his own actions towards his students. He remembers how he would casually inquire about their well-being but never truly cared to understand what was really happening to the transfer student—or to any of his students. Throughout the game, the player's identity shifts several times. They embody the transfer student, the teacher, and another bullied student who interacts with the transfer student(in the locker). In the later act, the transfer student realize just hiding would not stop other students from bullying, he begins to seek revenge, and the teacher/player is left as the last one standing. The ending leaves it to the player's imagination to consider what fate might await him. I realize this might be a bit hard to follow, but I'll try something less complex next time... maybe. shorts: playthrough: ( hiding place is at 01:30)

Whispers in the Dark When the lights die, the house awakens. Trapped inside an old family home, you are hunted by two restless spirits: the innocent whispers of a young girl that lure you deeper into the dark, and the wrathful shadow of a fallen soldier who strikes when the power fails. Every creak, every flicker, and every breath may be your last as you search for a way out. Will you uncover the truth behind their deaths—or become part of the houseâs story forever?

Whispers in the Night is a playable horror story about a woman named Syri Carter traveling through the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia when her car suddenly breaks down. About twelve miles away from her grandmother's cabin, with no cell service, and dwindling temperatures, Syri has to figure out what her next move is. It's up to you to guide her path and get her to safety or let her fall victim to the darker forces of the forest.

<TITLE>Horror Vacui</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Ghostbrite</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://ghostbrite.itch.io/horror-vacui</URL>
<TEXT>
Horror Vacui was created as a solo project/first ever game by Skelefactor founder Tony Ransom. It was designed to be a game that is simple to pick up, but also to continually surprise the players. The basic premise is that you must clear a series of rooms by controlling each floor tile in each room. Various enemies wander about, stealing your control from each tile that they walk on. You can destroy the enemies, but only by powering up through the claiming of tiles. A strange sort of resource management and suspense arises from the dynamic of tile claiming and enemy take-downs. Five unique worlds with strange mechanics to master. A host of eldritch enemies to keep you guessing. Novel boss battles that introduce additional game-play twists. An incomprehensible codex that reveals more "information" as you progress. Additional modes of play, including a Hardcore mode, if you can manage to unlock them. Secret power-ups that fundamentally change how you can approach each game. We've been told it's pretty hard, so heads up on that. Though Horror Vacui's development may be completed, we at Skelefactor are committed to the life-long support of all of our games. From time to time we'll get ideas on how to enhance a particular aspect, or a player will alert us to an obscure bug. As long as we're alive, we're going to keep making these things better. skelefactor.com

I've been continually asked to release battle sprites for the Horror City packs and, despite not particularly being happy with these results, I've decided to release them. If you wish to use these, you may do so for free, though donations are always welcome. Again, these are unfinished, archived resources, not optimised for any engine. Do not redistribute.

<TEXT>
Ravenwood Horror is a horror themed puzzle game. I made it a while back in 2008 (under the nickname Min Chan). But when I discovered this awesome site I decide to share it here as well for (hopefully) your enjoyment! It's made in RPG Maker VX. You assume the role of psychiatrist Henry Smith, who is trapped at the mansion of his recently gone crazy patient H. Wilkins. You need to explore and solve puzzles in order to escape and find out what is the cause of all this mess. Multiple endings depending on your actions (full exploration is rewarded!) and about 2 hours of gameplay for your first time. There is a hint walkthrough in the game files, and also a few let's plays videos on YouTube. This game is fanmade using resources not made by me and as such is a free game. However if you want to donate and help the bill paying while I'm working on my current project, you are more than welcome to do so! Thank you for taking the time to check the game out, I hope you enjoy!

<TEXT>
Designed for RPG Maker, this 10-track pack aims to supplement your horror-mystery game with instrumental compositions. Preview https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/416230211&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true Terms A copy of the terms of usage is included in the download files. Please read it before using it, but in short, credit me (CeremonialDoll3702) in all occasions, and also remember to send me a free copy of the game if used in commercial games (edit: please just forget about sending me a copy from now on... that was such a stupid rule. I now waive the requirement to send me a free copy.). What is Included 10 tracks, with some extra "soundscape" tracks. Some extra SE (RPG Maker sound effects), and some ME (music effects) are also included. Usage If you simply want to use this in your game, download the first file (with ogg, mp3), and simply copy all the ogg files (or mp3 files, just that I personally recommend ogg over mp3) into their respective folders. If you want to also want to remix, or to do some editing on the tracks themselves for your personal usage, you should download the uncompressed flac files first. Donating If you donate at least $3 to me through itch.io on this product (which means I get $2.7 with the default share, so if you want to do it any other way that results in me getting $2.7 through itch.io, I am fine with it), the crediting rule and the give me a free copy of your commercial game rule is waived. See the LICENSE.txt file for more details. And just in case it gets confusing: donating is optional for using the music, please read the LICENSE.txt in the downloaded files.

<TITLE>Horror AI Toolkit</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Hickery</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://hickery.itch.io/unity-horror-ai-toolkit</URL>
<TEXT>
This toolkit provides a customisable AI system for you to include in your own Unity projects, focusing primarily on the creation of enemies for horror games. Inspired by games such as Left 4 Dead and Alien: Isolation , a director AI governs the aggression of enemies, groups them together and can dynamically spawn and remove them to alter the pacing during game play. The toolkit is flexible and can support a number of AIs at a given time, ranging from a single enemy to larger groups. Included in the download is a short game demo, along with showcases of the AI, as well as the toolkit itself. The primary features of this toolkit include: A director AI which controls the pacing of the game, as well as the aggression of AI enemies, through a Stress Meter.  The director can also group AIs together, and can dynamically spawn and remove enemies based on the current Stress Level. Three prebuilt AI types. Advanced AI, which offer more detailed features and work individually. Basic AI, which are more simplistic but can be organised into groups. Scout AI, which will signal nearby allies to come to their aid. Advanced sound and sight search. AI agents will learn different types of sounds, and will begin to ignore any which they have heard too often. Node based navigation and learning. Nodes can be placed within a level to mark rooms or points of interest, and can be given a room type. The AI will used these nodes to learn the player's behaviour. The more often they spot the player near a node type, the more likely they will search that type in the future. All features can be customised to your liking and even toggled off. Other features include: Hide in objects. Place lockers which the player can hide in to avoid detection from enemies. Certain enemy types can search these and pull the player out. Doors. The player can open and close doors, and can also peek around them in order to see whats on the other side. AI will also navigate through and open doors. A flashlight power and flickering system. The player can collect batteries in order to power their flashlight, which will dim and flicker when low on energy. Current issues and future development: A player sanity system, making use of the AI director to make small changes to levels and place objects, as well as spawning audio and scare cues. Currently the player's actions are dependant on Unity's first person controller standard asset, which I have made some changes to. If you are also using this controller in your own project, please be aware of potential conflicts which may occur. I plan on removing these dependencies in the future.

<TEXT>
This pack includes 10 professionally-made ambient soundtracks, suitable for horror games, movies or youtube videos. Every file has at least one variation and three file formats, meaning that you're actually buying over 50 individual tracks! Some of these are made specially for this pack, and others are tracks I made for abandoned projects of mine. All tracks include wav, mp3 and ogg versions ready to be dropped into any project! All of the included tracks can be used in any commercial project. It would be appreciated if you credit me in your project! Play the video to hear some snippets of the included tracks! Tracklist with descriptions for each track below: Night of the Infection - A short but extremely unnerving soundscape, perfect for a zombie uprising. Darkest Souls - A short,  intense loop with heavy drums and a choir in the background. Perfect for a big boss battle! Blood Moon - The demons have risen and you must sneak out of the city! This track teases the fact that something may be near, but you can never be sure... Faraway Night - You can hear a distant piano playing. Who is playing it, I wonder? This sad piece transforms into a more hopeful song, and is designed to be a loop for a title screen or credits sequence. Also comes with a version containing less reverb resulting in a clearer piano sound. They're Coming - A progressive  soundscape with a hellish end, including many distant demons. They're coming... we must go. Chains - A very unnerving, metallic soundscape, using a sample from one of the tracks from my horror game - Tenome! Intergalactic Horror - A sci-fi horror ambience. Dark synths tease that something is coming. Possession - A ghost has entered your home and is attempting to control you. Try to survive the ghastly moans and droans in this track. Her Music Box - After she died, we never touched her favourite music box, yet it never stops playing its demonic tune. Exploring the Night - A dark and mysterious soundscape, fitting for an exploration game or ghost-hunting series. (BONUS) Escape From Hell - An intense music track, accompanying one's escape from the demons of hell using synths and guitars. This was used for a now-abandoned project of mine, in a level where you were being chased by hordes of demons through a hellish landscape. Also, the second drop is my favourite. Still not convinced?

<TITLE>Horror Effects plugin for RPG Maker MV$8.99-10%</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Olivia</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://fallenangelolivia.itch.io/horror-effects-plugin</URL>
<TEXT>
This is a RPG Maker MV plugin that will allow you to add visual horror effects to your game's title screen, maps, events, pictures, battle, etc. You can turn on individual effects at a time or multiple simultaneously. The effects include a noise effect, a glitch effect, and a TV effect, which is commonly seen used in most horror films. Now, you can use these effects in RPG Maker MV, too! Be warned that this plugin was made in RPG Maker MV 1.6.1 and is untested in lower versions so I cannot guarantee if it will work. To update to the latest version, please download the update here to at least 1.6.1 . Sample Project Includes The sample project download for this will include the following: The main plugin itself along with some supporting plugins . The plugin can run without these supporting plugins as they are only used for the purpose of demonstrating in the sample project. Sample plugin commands and demonstrated individually on various aspects of the game so you can double check your work with mine to make sure it works in your game. Preconfigured plugin parameters to add the Horror Effects to your title screen, too! Plugin Parameters Title1 Effects: Animate the Title1 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects? This will be the first image used in the Database, System, Title Screen setting for your game. Title2 Effects: Animate the Title2 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects? This will be the second image used in the Database, System, Title Screen setting for your game. Default Noise Settings: When applying noise effects to sprites in-game, this will be the default settings used. Default Glitch Settings: When applying glitch effects to sprites in-game, this will be the default settings used.

<TEXT>
InformaÃ§Ãµes bÃ¡sicas TÃ­tulo: Lilith: um horror visual novel GÃªnero: visual novel, horror, drama ClassificaÃ§Ã£o: 16 anos PÃºblico-alvo: jovens e adultos Engine: RenâPy Engine Data de inicializaÃ§Ã£o: janeiro de 2018 SituaÃ§Ã£o: projeto em desenvolvimento Tempo de jogo: aprox. 30 minutos VersÃ£o: demo 1.3 FEEDBACK: https://forms.gle/iVncP2Xiot2Si4jw5 Por favor, deixe o seu feedback preenchendo o formulÃ¡rio acima. Proposta Este projeto Ã© o resultado de um ano do meu Trabalho de ConclusÃ£o de Curso e, apesar de ter sido pensado para ser mais extenso, foi realizado apenas o capÃ­tulo um do enredo. A proposta principal deste jogo Ã© trabalhar questÃµes sobre a bruxaria na Idade Moderna por meio de uma personagem bruxa que tivesse caracterÃ­sticas mais significativas, contornando estereÃ³tipos misÃ³ginos que foram consolidados ao longo dos sÃ©culos a respeito da bruxa histÃ³rica. Em outras palavras, desenvolver uma bruxa que tivesse mais voz e empoderamento a fim de enfrentar os preconceitos de sua Ã©poca. Enredo No auge da InquisiÃ§Ã£o, Lilith, uma jovem camponesa, passa a sonhar com a figura do bode. Preocupada com o que isso possa significar, ela tenta se redimir de seus pecados, mas acaba conhecendo no caminho uma mulher suspeita e mal falada na Vila que comeÃ§a a incitar nela o desejo de revolta contra as obrigaÃ§Ãµes impostas pela sua famÃ­lia e pela igreja local. Lilith descobrirÃ¡, entÃ£o, que existe outra opÃ§Ã£o para sua vida pacata, um caminho sem volta em direÃ§Ã£o Ã  bruxaria.

This game was made in 7 days for the Scream Season game jam. Your goal is to collect the presents from the front of the train and bring them to the back without getting caught by the horror patrolling the train cars. NOTE: Due to browser updates, the Armory Engine can no longer lock your mouse in windowed mode or on anything besides Chrome. Firefox will not lock your mouse and you will be unable to turn unless you use the arrow keys which are assigned to tank controls. Internet Explorer/Edge is not supported by the Armory engine because that browser is trash. If you're going to play in browser, you must play it on Chrome in fullscreen for mouse input, use the tank controls/arrow keys, otherwise download the game. If you're experiencing performance or loading issues, we also recommend the downloadable version. We hope you enjoy this short game!

If not just google it its pretty easy . You can download and install this games build on your Quest for free this way! You might be asking why don't we just release this on Oculus Quest store but the truth is it is much harder then other stores, since the level of game has to be really high for the game to get it published into the App store. And quite frankly we didn't even tried to publish it because we know our game is not there yet, but we will keep working hard on the game so we can reach the level so we can get it published! We won't be updating the version of the build that is available for download, but in the future we will definitely support cross-buy if we will qet to Quest App store. In future updates: Flashlight feature, Replay ability, Better interaction with monsters etc.. If you would guys like to support us. Go and buy our game in Oculus Rift, Go App store or here SteamVR will follow..

You will have to take care of all 5 bombs prepared for destroying the mine. http://paperbunker.cz ------ 5.8.2019 Version 0.2: Because, Oculus made some changes in latest firmware.. Our version for the Quest wasn't playable. So, we fixed it.. Plus added fancy vibration when you have some jump scares :)

The basic premise is that you must clear a series of rooms by controlling each floor tile in each room. Various enemies wander about, stealing your control from each tile that they walk on. You can destroy the enemies, but only by powering up through the claiming of tiles. A strange sort of resource management and suspense arises from the dynamic of tile claiming and enemy take-downs. Five unique worlds with strange mechanics to master. A host of eldritch enemies to keep you guessing. Novel boss battles that introduce additional game-play twists. An incomprehensible codex that reveals more "information" as you progress. Additional modes of play, including a Hardcore mode, if you can manage to unlock them. Secret power-ups that fundamentally change how you can approach each game. We've been told it's pretty hard, so heads up on that. Though Horror Vacui's development may be completed, we at Skelefactor are committed to the life-long support of all of our games. From time to time we'll get ideas on how to enhance a particular aspect, or a player will alert us to an obscure bug. As long as we're alive, we're going to keep making these things better. skelefactor.com

This is archive content! As such, I will likely not be providing updates on it or answering technical issues regarding game engines I have no knowledge of. I've been continually asked to release battle sprites for the Horror City packs and, despite not particularly being happy with these results, I've decided to release them. If you wish to use these, you may do so for free, though donations are always welcome. Again, these are unfinished, archived resources, not optimised for any engine. Do not redistribute. Please give credit if used, and I hope you find some enjoyment in them!

Ravenwood Horror is a horror themed puzzle game. I made it a while back in 2008 (under the nickname Min Chan). But when I discovered this awesome site I decide to share it here as well for (hopefully) your enjoyment! It's made in RPG Maker VX. You assume the role of psychiatrist Henry Smith, who is trapped at the mansion of his recently gone crazy patient H. Wilkins. You need to explore and solve puzzles in order to escape and find out what is the cause of all this mess. Multiple endings depending on your actions (full exploration is rewarded!) and about 2 hours of gameplay for your first time. There is a hint walkthrough in the game files, and also a few let's plays videos on YouTube. This game is fanmade using resources not made by me and as such is a free game. However if you want to donate and help the bill paying while I'm working on my current project, you are more than welcome to do so! Thank you for taking the time to check the game out, I hope you enjoy!

<TEXT>
Designed for RPG Maker, this 10-track pack aims to supplement your horror-mystery game with instrumental compositions. Preview https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/416230211&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true Terms A copy of the terms of usage is included in the download files. Please read it before using it, but in short, credit me (CeremonialDoll3702) in all occasions, and also remember to send me a free copy of the game if used in commercial games (edit: please just forget about sending me a copy from now on... that was such a stupid rule. I now waive the requirement to send me a free copy.). What is Included 10 tracks, with some extra "soundscape" tracks. Some extra SE (RPG Maker sound effects), and some ME (music effects) are also included. Usage If you simply want to use this in your game, download the first file (with ogg, mp3), and simply copy all the ogg files (or mp3 files, just that I personally recommend ogg over mp3) into their respective folders. If you want to also want to remix, or to do some editing on the tracks themselves for your personal usage, you should download the uncompressed flac files first. Donating If you donate at least $3 to me through itch.io on this product (which means I get $2.7 with the default share, so if you want to do it any other way that results in me getting $2.7 through itch.io, I am fine with it), the crediting rule and the give me a free copy of your commercial game rule is waived. See the LICENSE.txt file for more details. And just in case it gets confusing: donating is optional for using the music, please read the LICENSE.txt in the downloaded files.

<TITLE>Horror AI Toolkit</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Hickery</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://hickery.itch.io/unity-horror-ai-toolkit</URL>
<TEXT>
This toolkit provides a customisable AI system for you to include in your own Unity projects, focusing primarily on the creation of enemies for horror games. Inspired by games such as Left 4 Dead and Alien: Isolation , a director AI governs the aggression of enemies, groups them together and can dynamically spawn and remove them to alter the pacing during game play. The toolkit is flexible and can support a number of AIs at a given time, ranging from a single enemy to larger groups. Included in the download is a short game demo, along with showcases of the AI, as well as the toolkit itself. The primary features of this toolkit include: A director AI which controls the pacing of the game, as well as the aggression of AI enemies, through a Stress Meter.  The director can also group AIs together, and can dynamically spawn and remove enemies based on the current Stress Level. Three prebuilt AI types. Advanced AI, which offer more detailed features and work individually. Basic AI, which are more simplistic but can be organised into groups. Scout AI, which will signal nearby allies to come to their aid. Advanced sound and sight search. AI agents will learn different types of sounds, and will begin to ignore any which they have heard too often. Node based navigation and learning. Nodes can be placed within a level to mark rooms or points of interest, and can be given a room type. The AI will used these nodes to learn the player's behaviour. The more often they spot the player near a node type, the more likely they will search that type in the future. All features can be customised to your liking and even toggled off. Other features include: Hide in objects. Place lockers which the player can hide in to avoid detection from enemies. Certain enemy types can search these and pull the player out. Doors. The player can open and close doors, and can also peek around them in order to see whats on the other side. AI will also navigate through and open doors. A flashlight power and flickering system. The player can collect batteries in order to power their flashlight, which will dim and flicker when low on energy. Current issues and future development: A player sanity system, making use of the AI director to make small changes to levels and place objects, as well as spawning audio and scare cues. Currently the player's actions are dependant on Unity's first person controller standard asset, which I have made some changes to. If you are also using this controller in your own project, please be aware of potential conflicts which may occur. I plan on removing these dependencies in the future.

<TEXT>
This pack includes 10 professionally-made ambient soundtracks, suitable for horror games, movies or youtube videos. Every file has at least one variation and three file formats, meaning that you're actually buying over 50 individual tracks! Some of these are made specially for this pack, and others are tracks I made for abandoned projects of mine. All tracks include wav, mp3 and ogg versions ready to be dropped into any project! All of the included tracks can be used in any commercial project. It would be appreciated if you credit me in your project! Play the video to hear some snippets of the included tracks! Tracklist with descriptions for each track below: Night of the Infection - A short but extremely unnerving soundscape, perfect for a zombie uprising. Darkest Souls - A short,  intense loop with heavy drums and a choir in the background. Perfect for a big boss battle! Blood Moon - The demons have risen and you must sneak out of the city! This track teases the fact that something may be near, but you can never be sure... Faraway Night - You can hear a distant piano playing. Who is playing it, I wonder? This sad piece transforms into a more hopeful song, and is designed to be a loop for a title screen or credits sequence. Also comes with a version containing less reverb resulting in a clearer piano sound. They're Coming - A progressive  soundscape with a hellish end, including many distant demons. They're coming... we must go. Chains - A very unnerving, metallic soundscape, using a sample from one of the tracks from my horror game - Tenome! Intergalactic Horror - A sci-fi horror ambience. Dark synths tease that something is coming. Possession - A ghost has entered your home and is attempting to control you. Try to survive the ghastly moans and droans in this track. Her Music Box - After she died, we never touched her favourite music box, yet it never stops playing its demonic tune. Exploring the Night - A dark and mysterious soundscape, fitting for an exploration game or ghost-hunting series. (BONUS) Escape From Hell - An intense music track, accompanying one's escape from the demons of hell using synths and guitars. This was used for a now-abandoned project of mine, in a level where you were being chased by hordes of demons through a hellish landscape. Also, the second drop is my favourite. Still not convinced? Download "Night of the Infection" for free below!

<TITLE>Horror Effects plugin for RPG Maker MV$8.99-10%</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Olivia</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://fallenangelolivia.itch.io/horror-effects-plugin</URL>
<TEXT>
This is a RPG Maker MV plugin that will allow you to add visual horror effects to your game's title screen, maps, events, pictures, battle, etc. You can turn on individual effects at a time or multiple simultaneously. The effects include a noise effect, a glitch effect, and a TV effect, which is commonly seen used in most horror films. Now, you can use these effects in RPG Maker MV, too! Be warned that this plugin was made in RPG Maker MV 1.6.1 and is untested in lower versions so I cannot guarantee if it will work. To update to the latest version, please download the update here to at least 1.6.1 . Sample Project Includes The sample project download for this will include the following: The main plugin itself along with some supporting plugins . The plugin can run without these supporting plugins as they are only used for the purpose of demonstrating in the sample project. Sample plugin commands and demonstrated individually on various aspects of the game so you can double check your work with mine to make sure it works in your game. Preconfigured plugin parameters to add the Horror Effects to your title screen, too! Plugin Parameters Title1 Effects: Animate the Title1 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects? This will be the first image used in the Database, System, Title Screen setting for your game. Title2 Effects: Animate the Title2 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects? This will be the second image used in the Database, System, Title Screen setting for your game. Default Noise Settings: When applying noise effects to sprites in-game, this will be the default settings used. Default Glitch Settings: When applying glitch effects to sprites in-game, this will be the default settings used. Default TV Settings: When applying TV effects to sprites in-game, this will be the default settings used. Plugin Commands To apply horror effects to your game, use these plugin commands in the following format: HorrorEffects target Create Noise

<TEXT>
InformaÃ§Ãµes bÃ¡sicas TÃ­tulo: Lilith: um horror visual novel GÃªnero: visual novel, horror, drama ClassificaÃ§Ã£o: 16 anos PÃºblico-alvo: jovens e adultos Engine: RenâPy Engine Data de inicializaÃ§Ã£o: janeiro de 2018 SituaÃ§Ã£o: projeto em desenvolvimento Tempo de jogo: aprox. 30 minutos VersÃ£o: demo 1.3 FEEDBACK: https://forms.gle/iVncP2Xiot2Si4jw5 Por favor, deixe o seu feedback preenchendo o formulÃ¡rio acima. Proposta Este projeto Ã© o resultado de um ano do meu Trabalho de ConclusÃ£o de Curso e, apesar de ter sido pensado para ser mais extenso, foi realizado apenas o capÃ­tulo um do enredo. A proposta principal deste jogo Ã© trabalhar questÃµes sobre a bruxaria na Idade Moderna por meio de uma personagem bruxa que tivesse caracterÃ­sticas mais significativas, contornando estereÃ³tipos misÃ³ginos que foram consolidados ao longo dos sÃ©culos a respeito da bruxa histÃ³rica. Em outras palavras, desenvolver uma bruxa que tivesse mais voz e empoderamento a fim de enfrentar os preconceitos de sua Ã©poca. Enredo No auge da InquisiÃ§Ã£o, Lilith, uma jovem camponesa, passa a sonhar com a figura do bode. Preocupada com o que isso possa significar, ela tenta se redimir de seus pecados, mas acaba conhecendo no caminho uma mulher suspeita e mal falada na Vila que comeÃ§a a incitar nela o desejo de revolta contra as obrigaÃ§Ãµes impostas pela sua famÃ­lia e pela igreja local. Lilith descobrirÃ¡, entÃ£o, que existe outra opÃ§Ã£o para sua vida pacata, um caminho sem volta em direÃ§Ã£o Ã  bruxaria.

<TEXT>
This game was made in 7 days for the Scream Season game jam. Your goal is to collect the presents from the front of the train and bring them to the back without getting caught by the horror patrolling the train cars. NOTE: Due to browser updates, the Armory Engine can no longer lock your mouse in windowed mode or on anything besides Chrome. Firefox will not lock your mouse and you will be unable to turn unless you use the arrow keys which are assigned to tank controls. Internet Explorer/Edge is not supported by the Armory engine because that browser is trash. If you're going to play in browser, you must play it on Chrome in fullscreen for mouse input, use the tank controls/arrow keys, otherwise download the game. If you're experiencing performance or loading issues, we also recommend the downloadable version. We hope you enjoy this short game!

<TEXT>
We are a small indie studio, which just released their first VR project Horror Nights Story to the Oculus store!

We see as the whole internet is calling for fnaf release to Oculus Quest and we would like to give you guys something like it.  We want to give you access to our game for free through technique of Sideload, if you are familiar with this. If not just google it its pretty easy . You can download and install this games build on your Quest for free this way! You might be asking why don't we just release this on Oculus Quest store but the truth is it is much harder then other stores, since the level of game has to be really high for the game to get it published into the App store. And quite frankly we didn't even tried to publish it because we know our game is not there yet, but we will keep working hard on the game so we can reach the level so we can get it published! We won't be updating the version of the build that is available for download, but in the future we will definitely support cross-buy if we will qet to Quest App store. In future updates: Flashlight feature, Replay ability, Better interaction with monsters etc.. If you would guys like to support us. Go and buy our game in Oculus Rift, Go App store or here SteamVR will follow.. Join our Discord https://discord.com/widget?id=584852114057199621&theme=dark And you can also follow us on twitter or instagram https://twitter.com/paperbunker https://instagram.com/paperbunkergames Thank you for your support! ------ Dig and find freedom through old mine, while running away from bloodthirsty horde of monsters, which is chasing you. But be on lookout! You will have to take care of all 5 bombs prepared for destroying the mine. http://paperbunker.cz ------ 5.8.2019 Version 0.2: Because, Oculus made some changes in latest firmware.. Our version for the Quest wasn't playable. So, we fixed it.. Plus added fancy vibration when you have some jump scares :)

<TITLE>Time Loop Traffic</TITLE>
<TEXT>You have 10 seconds to drive every hover car in the city to its destination—at the same time. Drive fast and dodge your past! The controls are straight-forward: push in the direction you want to go. Follow your little navigation arrow to the marked destination. Then do it again and again, avoiding the traffic chaos your past selves will create. Most importantly though, tell us your score in the comments. Time Loop Traffic was made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 51 (âEvery 10 Secondsâ) and ranked 35th out of 1702 entries. You can follow us on Twitter , get our newsletter , or you can wishlist our new first-person horror game : Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Very interesting and fun. Was expecting it to demand some kind of strategy or twist to increase the score, but then it just told me I won. I did it, 675. Very interesting idea, captivating game loop Sounds like "Does not Commute" by Mediocre/Tuxedo Labs managed to do it on my second try - 650 A very nice idea, mechanics and gfx and the gameplay is very nice... a very replayable game this one could get popular and its a browser game! I wish it well! 546 Seems like a cool game, I've played games like this before years ago, sadly your game doesn't work on Firefox, I was able to play it by switching to chrome but it would be nice if you included a download link Pretty strong game. Some minor changes and it is ready for casual gamers...besides its difficulty. I could totally imagine this game with online highscore and ghosts of other players driving around too.</TEXT>

Thank you! I had a tight self imposed deadline and a lot of stuff on my plate so it's great to see that the ideas still made their way through to the player. Wish I had more time to flesh them out, but I'm pretty happy with what came out :D</TEXT>

This is fun!, nice concept XD Fun game, I like how it's as hard as the player makes it for themselves. Very clever game with twists and turns! The last level is very hard! Thank you! I really liked it, pretty short but good concept! Thank you! Amazing! Well designed game with a really neat mechanic! 5/5 :D Keep up the great work! :) Thanks :) It was fun to have to die to avoid the paradox. Thanks :) Cool thing! simple game elements and interesting puzzle levels, good job! Thank you :) Reminds me of a very similar mechanic in Braid. Awesome job. At times the levels didn't restart so I had to go back to the menu. Thank your for the review.:) Yeah there are sum bugs that I couldn't fix before the deadline. Will wait for the gamejam voting to complete and then will update again. This is such a cool idea, the execution is really great too! Thank you! :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Time Loop Tower (VR only!)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and Android Stack the Jenga blocks to create the tallest tower possible within 10 seconds. You are in a time loop however. You can't what has already happened in past loops, but you can build upon it and cheat time to achieve the impossible in this physics-based virtual reality building game. VR Only! Requires a desktop VR system (SteamVR or Oculus desktop) or Oculus/Meta Quest or Quest 2. Do not try to play this game without VR. I made this game in 2 days for 12 Days of Sketchmas Game Jam 2022. It combines 3 of the 12 themes from the jam: Restart (Day 3), Stack (Day 4), Time (Day 6). This is a very "new year" game. Every year is like another iteration of the time loop. You can't change the past, but you can learn from it and build upon it the next time around. Stack and loop until you get bored or reach your desired stack height and get a new high score. It's a sandbox!

But you can experience this feeling in this 2D platformer built in one week during the #BrackeysGameJam. You are stuck in a house which is differently structured and built in every single year you time travel to. You'll have to rewind the time to when the house was still full, abandoned or rebuilt. Your goal is to get to the top of the house by completing a parkour trail. But be careful, it's not safe in there! Monsters and traps are waiting for you! Controls are mentioned on the title screen! Good luck and stay safe! Game created by Inkuantum and Greggy.17 Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Good game!

You can never know), the time will go back and you will have to remember the order of the junk. In the game you will spawn as a lost jet in a time channel, with time junk in 3 positions. The junk is numbered to help you remember the order of the junk. After you go through all of the junk the time will go back, and you will have to remember the reversed order. Keys: w and s or up and down arrows - move up and down esc - return to the main menu have fun!

There is no clear narrative for the "game" and it is closer to an experience of what the Time Loop feels like than a story. You may find yourself lost between the many parts, as they are almost always interconnected and it can be confusing to find yourself going through a different route.

But if you do not send the email, im afraid i cant contact you... Really liked your game intro, it was difficult for me to event cross first level :) coolï¼ A bit to overlypunishing game, good ideas for the game: -coyote time -shorter levels -smaller hitboxes -make the game style cocnsistent I do really like the videos when dying and switching levels, did you make them yourself? (I don't see any credits for assets used so congratz on that). I did find that the game was a bit too simple/tedious for my taste, I'd have liked a bit more challenge and less just moving sideways for thousands of pixels. Also something that you could look into is improved character movement scripts, for a platformer that's really what people are doing 90% of the time: moving. I love how mario handles it: going up normally, like you do, then possibly have some hang time where if you keep up pressed, you stay at the same height, and afterwards going down with double the gravity, feels way more reactive. fun game! Good Game! I can't even beat level 3 Nice pixel art and music! Lol struggling a bit for the second level Amazing game great music and the stages are just so exiting but when you hear the beeping it's just so intense I can tell the game maker put slot of effort into rpthis game he must have stayed up until 4:00am 5â­â­â­â­â­ Thank you so much</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game The character is young, small and red in color, but weak. We're orphans in a village that's being attacked by the villain, and our goal is to protect the village from him. Seeing us fail in our mission, the master of time decides to make us enter a time loop. Unfortunately, this new character isn't nice in reality, and simply wants us to survive, even if it means abandoning the village, by setting 2 conditions to get out of the loop: the first is not to die, and the second is that the village itself must be destroyed. So we're left with a possible âdouble endingâ: either we continue playing and have to save the village ad infinitum. Or we find a way to escape, knowing that our village will be destroyed.

Plans for future updates include: Our original plans for this game have included originally making the different environments (Forest/Desert) and have each new section have a key mechanic. For example, we have unused assets of a different playable character that is smaller but faster. There was plans for the ability to change what type of rock you were to solve a certain level.

<TEXT>Your are Dr. Kessler, an archaeologist, and you've stumbled across mysterious ancient ruins in the jungle. Only TIME will tell what secret powers they hold... (Creator's note: You can enter through ~most~ doorways, so try doors if you see 'em!) Also, a link to some atmospheric tunes (because adding music to Bitsy hurts my brain): Story Outline: Intro Rising Action Finale Concepts : When creating my game, there were a variety of things I took into consideration to make the game experience, and therefore the narrative experience, flow with ease. These were, primarily, the artwork, room layout, and transitions. I wanted the player to better understand what was happening, how to navigate the world, and have some agency in the overall experience. The artwork was the most critical for helping the player understand what was going on, and their position in the game world. In an 8bit world, the artwork is incredibly simplistic. Because of this limitation, it was important to be consistent with the way things appeared, and to make the art easily recognizable at a basal level. âWhen pictures are more abstracted from âreality,â they require greater levels of perception more like words. (McCloud, pg. 49)â The player must work harder to make out what things are with what little details are present. So, it was vital to distinguish different game elements. I made the playerâs avatar, the sprites, and items in game white so that they would consistently standout from the background. Navigation was also important to the game/storytelling experience. Traveling in between rooms in Bitsy is much like navigating panels in a comic. According to McCloud, these panels â...fracture both time and space… (pg. 67)â I approached this in several ways. First, I emphasized that the character and world were moving backwards by having the player move right to left; the opposite direction in which we read. Only in spaces that did not travel backwards in time did this change. I also made sure that the direction the character was consistent between rooms to avoid discombobulating the player. I also had certain elements span multiple rooms, such as the railroad in the wild west portion of the game. Lastly, the transitions were a vital component to capturing the time travel aspect of the game. Our brains naturally want to fill in the blanks between transitions, and they are therefore âcreating the illusion of time and motion. (pg. 94)â However, it is essential that the game takes advantage of this mechanism, and works in conjunction with it, in order for the game to flow. To initiate the idea of time travel, I dedicated an entire room to move the player into the past; accompanied with animated tiles and bright pink background. I also, very simply, added wavy transitions between exits to establish that the player was traveling through time. There were some takeaways from theme park design and narrative that also inspired my work. When brainstorming for the project, I made sure to reflect upon high concept ideas. Having a simple one sentence idea pitch solidified my primary goal, and was the guiding principle in most of my decision making. It presented all sorts of questions that aided in my creative process. (Quirky scenarios? Butterfly effect? Paradoxes? Etc…) I also storyboarded for the project, and made sure to have concrete ideas for each room before actually fleshing it out. This helped to define pivotal moments in the narrative, and also finalize the narrative itself. And, take the previous high concept idea and turn it into something tangible. The concept of the Disney âweenieâ was also an important component of my game design. I made sure to place things in the game world to act as visual magnets. Primarily, for navigation purposes, I made distinct animations for the exits in each room: a blinking square time portal. No matter where the player was in the room (or world), they knew what to look for to progress. I also placed other game tiles to suggest possible modes of travel, such as the railroad or doors in buildings. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

Brilliant concept! really enjoyed trying to beat it. There's a lot of reading, but once we are past the text-based tutorial, It's crazy addicting! I ended up spending 2 hours and going through over 40 weeks trying to earn more than previous week loop! My Highscore: 527000 B-) As for feedback, The tutorial could be simplified a bit, but that's just me nit-picking. Once we get through texts, there is no stopping the player! Nice, that beats mine! I didn't have time to add an endless mode but I thought it would be fun. Agreed on the tutorial -- a lot of the times I get feedback that I under-tutorialize so I wanted to make the concepts more clear, but ideally the UI does all the work. Awesome aesthetic, great music, fun concept. Overall a very polished little game.</TEXT>

Time Loop Escape is a platformer with horror elements.The control is carried out by pressing the buttons A, D, space.The plot of the game is quite simple:you play as a man who has nightmares and who is stuck in time in his dream.The task is to escape from the monster in order to wake up and thereby get out of the time loop.Be careful because if the monster catches you, you will die in reality (in the reality of the game) and you will have to start all over from the beginning.Good luck!

<TITLE>Time Loop at Gary's</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Time Loop at Gary's is a project that I've been working on for over a year now. Originally planned to release on FNAF's 10 year aniversary, the development has quickly spiraled out of control. With the GMTK Game Jam 2025's theme being "Loop" I decided to finally push this thing off my chest . Currently working on a devlog video about it (hopefully I can actually finish it before the end of summer). The game came from a funny idea to try and combine the Terminator with Five Nights at Freddy's. In the game you play as a birthday boy whose special day at Gary's goes horribly wrong when everyone disappears and blood thirsty robots begin to hunt him down. He hides in a weird office to try to survive through the nightmare. All the 3D models and animations by PocoPremium All music and sounds taken from Pixabay (can't remember the exact creators sorry :( ) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I think this game is a well made parody of fnaf, the animatronic desgins look good, and the mechanics are great, and in general its a great small game to play, so i recomnd it. The games is really interesting to play. It is not too long. Animatronics made well. I do recommend to give it a try.</TEXT>

Would you consider donating Mac Steam keys so that no one can freely distribute your game? If that doesn't work for you either, I understand. most intelligent scammer i was so confused until i saw this excuse me, could you tell me if I buy this music can I use it on my videogame creation? or its just for listening purposes? What do you think? You can't use someone else's music just because you buy it woo take it easy dude, is a question you need some calming pills You're allowed to use it for anything after purchase as long as it is only visible to you and you do not make any profit off of it. I was wondering: are there plans to release the new tracks that were added in the level editor update? Yup! Once the editor is officially out :) Thank you! I love the new tracks! I did notice, though, that the "tinker" music is still missing—was that intentional? Hi, I'm a teacher who would like to use Baba in schools and help promote it in NYC.

Link: https://tallercreacionvideojuegos.itch.io/baba-is-you ive never fucking expected that uhm. just saying the game credits this one ItÂ´s a school for videogames creation. Yeah, this seems to be someone trying to recreate BiY to learn, and to have fun. They also credit the original designer. Game is fun Fun make rate Rate is 10 Baba love game the beginning of a beautiful game. baba is me me is happy happy is rate rate is 10 10 is out out is of of is 100 What are these cursed comments? Comment Is Cursed Baba Is Laugh TheCoolManOfEpicness Is Rate Rate Is 10 Amazing game, Really wish there was a longer and more polished version though.. hmmmm i wonderrrrr ...This is just a copy of the original Baba is You. Atleast MENTION it's a copy or fangame or something This is actually the original version before the game was developed and released as a proper game. Oh, cool! its made by the same person who made biy though hmm baba is classic The base structure is similar to other puzzle games where you push and move things to reach the goal, but an important difference with respect to other games is that the rules of the level itself are included in the scenario as objects within it that can be pushed and changed at the convenience of the player. This gives a very curious feeling of feeling smarter than the game because of that feeling of breaking or changing rules, but it really is a fairly open system that allows you to pass levels in different ways. Games made in game jams are usually small due to the fact that you have a tiny amount of time to develop a game from scratch (usually 2 to 7 days) but sometimes quite original ideas come out like this title that turned a small prototype in an award winning in its complete version of 2019. Is there a difference between the zip builds? On the surface it seems not. They both seem functionally the same. He might have polished it a bit more or fixed something but it seems identical. How to customize baba is you jam build? There is a secret level editor here, all you need to do is press the \ button. yo, hempuli not sure if you'll see this but could you put slip into the level editor, many thanks. There is a secret level editor, actually. Hempuli has instructions on how to use it in the description. i love this game, i give it 999999/10 i will be getting the full game, absolute brain teaser, the dev did so well, there are no bugs (that I've found) this game is awesome, i'm surprised that this was a game jam for how impressive the puzzles are. baba is you in jam build does not work in windows 10 right, well i run on 8.1 it does hi hi hi (Let's start a chain) hi I used a windows 10 pc and it worked completely fine This is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played, and it is a jam game!? Congratulations! I am incredibly jealous of your talent! If you haven't played it yet, check out the full game! Soooo much bigger, absolutely crazy puzzles too! Not to mention that the level editor is now public to everyone. If you didn't have access to the beta, now you do! Did you know KILL was renamed to DEFEAT after the full game yes I always read DEFEAT as DEATH Please add Linux support :) yes its not give me to download, its saying : cnot open executable file you have to extract the file firs its sad that there is none for Mac users :( The new full version does, it costs about Â£10 though. I met the creator of the game :D Ye u met hemp In the first level i made it so that rock is win on accident when i figured out i could change rules. So then in the "Wall is stop" Level i made myself the wall me too lol plz give me .mfa so i have download baba is you and when i go to open it, it give me a black screen with green edges and does nothing... help make sure the path to the game doesnt have any bad symbols, like cyrrilic Oh hey look, it's blokos! gra pe fan :) Baba love grape too :) Deleted post i have made a mod on itch of this version. rebateman is low on ideas rebateman needs help here is mod plz help Game Is Amazing Brain Is Hurting (Really good work!!) FranzDaMLG is stuck FranzDaMLG is Bamboozle FranzDaMLG is Quit Movement was a bit laggy, but nice game overall. You've definitely made a lot of improvements in the full version. How do u use the level editor? Key Right To The"Enter" Key IS Editor i tried to press enter but it didnt work and another enter either! Game Is Awesome Fullversion Is Expensive Harry Is Broke Harry Is Sad Guest1 is smart Pirated version is free pirated version doesn't reward the developers for their hard work. Guest1 is thief identical copies of digital goods takes no work or time. stealing of digital goods is a logical fallacy. amplified 1 should think about "No DRM". are you saying that a developer should only be able to sell one copy? should films only have to sell one ticket? Think of it as a tip, then, or even a suggested donation when entering a museum or gallery. Maybe it's not literally stealing to opt out of the agreed-upon price, but it's still a dick move. Unless you want to become an old-school patron and pay devs a salary with room and board out of your own pocket in exchange for games that you freely share with everyone. Because that's the alternative to players sharing the cost of the work and time. Pirate is smart Everyone is pirate Dev is broke Dev is sad Game is Pirate is problem Mistake Is Guest1, Pirate Is Bad, Guest1 Is Regret Guest1 is pirate Guest1 is not pay People seeing Guest1 follow Guest1 People is not pay Hempuli has not money Hempuli make not game Game is not more Game not without pirate is not more please help i have black screen when i run the game pls help Are you on Windows 10? yes i am on windows 10 Could you contact me at the e-mail address found on this page: http://www.hempuli.com/press/sheet.php?p=Baba_Is_You ? Don't extract (When you extrakt the level-data is gone) same here and i dont know how to fix it Where did you extract the game zip? Or are you playing the game straight from the zip file? What sort of Windows 10 computer can't handle a 2D game? It even works on Windows XP ! An Excelent Game, there were moments when I really said "Aha" and felt incredible. Thanks! Aha moments are great, but this game also has some of the elusive "wait, but if I instead..." moments. question, I have the new retail release. I have yet to try this but are the levels different? Is the game different? Thanks in advance for all your hard work! Most of the levels in the jam version are in the final game; some of the rule logic is different and/or more buggy in the jam version. Thank you! Question: Its just a black screen. How do i play the game? There should be a title screen when you start. Make sure the game isn't in a folder that doesn't have reading permission; other than that, I might not be able to help much :( Masterpiece, brillant game... When i get the money i will buy this without doubt! I "bought" (donated) to get this game here on itch.io, and I totally loved it. Could I please get a redeemable code to download the version that's on the Steam store? My username here is jobury and my username on Steam is neoaxelfire thats not how buying things works Well, see the thing is, you don't need to donate for this one. It's free. It's a nice thing to do but not required. Also, unless you donated like $20 it's not enough to pay for full. </TEXT>

THERE'S NO UNDO OR RESTART FEATURE!!!!!! how do you make it so that you can win by coming into contact with something like baba coming into contact with the flag for example very gud i like it i would be so stoked if u made a "full version" or just more levels in general i would definitely recommend playing this how do you beat the big river one? you do how do you finish the level with a lot of water? (no, not the smol river one, the huge river one. Make the water pushable, then make the rock the victory How do you do the level with the river? I think I need to be able to go through walls to finish it but I can't make myself go through walls. rock is win It's alright. Though, the rules are more difficult to use, because words aren't written out. There's also a lot of feedback effects missing. It would be nice if you added something of your own to differentiate it from the original. its a demake... its supposed to be as similar as possible but worse lolll</TEXT>

<TITLE>Baba Is You - PuzzleScript Demake</TITLE>
<TEXT>WASD/Arrow Keys to move Z to undo R to restart If the game does not work for you or you are on mobile, try this link: https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=be9cf6d355003371750d6950646022e5 A PuzzleScript demake of the mechanics seen in the early levels of the game Baba Is You developed by Arvi Teikari. The goal for this project is that in any scenario that can be created in the level editor, the tiles will have the exact same functionality they would in the original game. To use the level editor, click the above link, press the "hack" button at the bottom of the screen, then press the "level editor" button that appears at the top of the screen. P.S. The PuzzleScript game engine has a maximum tile resolution of 5x5 pixels, thus the words have been abbreviated to their first letter. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Make hot and melt and add a level where you can horizontally write Flag IS Hot. wait how tf is this possible Nice it's like the original Baba Is You but for broke ppl Would recommend playing but unfortunately it's too short Whenever I hack the code, I can't move the player. @Galatical Do you still have the source code? Can you send it to me? Hmm, I just checked and you're right. The source code has always been what you see there, so I think some sort of weird PuzzleScript bug introduced in an update must have caused this. Either way, I removed the first line that created a player object on every tile and simply gave the play a letter in the legend and placed it manually in the corner of each level, and that fixed it. I've updated the link that says "If the game does not work for you, or you are on mobile, try this link" to a new, working version. See if that works for you! now we have two baba is you in puzzlescript https://pyjamads.itch.io/baba-is-you-demake ð Why are text so unreadable?? The engine I used to make this, PuzzleScript, is very limited. The maximum sprite size is 5x5 pixels, the best I could do to represent words is to just put the first letter of the word. This makes understanding the game nearly impossible if you havenât played the original, but itâs the best I could do with the tools. Iâd recommend checking out the âPuzzleScriptâ tag on itch.io to see more examples of games made using the engine, thereâs a lot of good ones.</TEXT>

You didn't make this lol Also, the up arrow doesn't work, for whatever reason? Relax bro :), it seems the account is a collection of games made by kids for learning I don't think Hempuli (the person who made Baba Is You) was part of that class... :) Although the sprites and the idea are blatantly stolen, the code isn't. Entire levels were blatantly stolen, too! You move with WASD since the arrow key implementation was half-added ;3 I know, I actually played it. In the first scene it is explained that this is reverse engineered. It is not original whatsoever.</TEXT>

<TITLE>A baba is you prototype (Re-coded, unofficial)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows A challenge I took up (I just know the basics of programmation). The complexity of its game design motivated me to try this out. There is still some bugs, specially when you controll different objects at once. I know I coded it any old how, and I did things in a probably really complex way when there are obviously a lot simplier ones, but I did my best. I got sprites and gifs and other visuals, either on the wiki page, or directly into the game by screening tiles by tiles and recreating gifs manually, or getting sounds from gamefiles. ------------------------------ Features : - Verbs : YOU, WIN, PUSH, STOP, SINK, DEFEAT, RED, BLUE - Logic : IS, NOT, AND -Objects : a lot -Undo function (not working if you undo a sink) - Around 20 levels - The hub/map - Saving progress - A konami code - My test room (with F11), if you want to play with rules - Bugs of course - Probably other things I forget Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS In the summer of 2020 I decided to test myself and remake one of my favorite puzzle games, Baba Is You. While the art isn't as good as it could be, I feel I got most of the core mechanics and words into the game. I reversed engineered the entire project by just playing the original game and figuring out how the code would work. Although I didn't add too many levels, I did create a level editor so you could make your own with the words I added. See if you could play around with the logic and find a bug!

<TITLE>Baba Is You Levelpack: As Expected</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable levelpack Most Baba Is You puzzles require rewriting the rules of the level. In this pack, there are no rules: everything is as expected. Right-click the game in Steam Library, Manage, Browse Local Files, and place the unzipped folder in the Worlds folder of the Data folder. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Okay so the updated world 2 is literally impossible to beat : You were supposed to bring a key and a Baba for the transform, but because of the row of fires, the other Baba would die instantly. You can't bring a rock since you need two keys and you can't open a door if a rock is on top of a key and bringing two Babas from one level is impossible to do. I had to move the flag one space down because of that. World 2 is possible to beat in the latest version. It's not trivial and should use all the resources you have in your screenshot (besides maybe the rocks). For a hint, there is a way to bring a key down and to the side with a delicate stars setup. Movement in the bottom section is definitely tight but doable. For the solution, a slightly modified version of what I showcase in my video for this level should work. If you said so. I moved the flag down anyways since I couldn't take it anymore. I don't even know the reason why you changed that level, it was okay in the showcase. try to get to this position</TEXT>

<TITLE>Baba Is You Levelpacks: Savefile Swamps</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable levelpack These packs don't use any mods (apart from a custom particle effect) or hidden text, but part of each revolves around a special exploit that can link two savefiles together. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I've completed levels 0, 1 and 2 on the left save file, level 0 on the right save file, and all 4 of the bonus levels on left all look impossible. Anything I'm missing? I mean levelpacks not save files. All the levels before what's at the very top of the main map don't use any meta or hidden mechanics, though the extras could be a difficulty spike. I notice you said "extras", and didn't mention level 0 right, which implies I'm just bad at the game. Alternatively, you could have just forgot to mention level 0 right, or you implied it in a very difficult to realise way. Sorry, I had forgotten that level 0 on the right does use a trick that you might not have encountered before, which makes it significantly harder than the opening levels on the left and maybe on par with the extra levels on the left. The right-side versions are intended to be more difficult than the left-side versions. I understand how... not necessarily bad, but still not good (please let that make sense) of an idea it is to give hints to your own game/levels/etc., but do the 5 levels I'm stuck on have anything to do with savefiles, (separate) levelpacks, or neither and It only requires one save file and it's possible without the other levelpack. They only require one save file and don't require doing anything in the other pack. The savefile/levelpack shenanigans start just after the top of the map. cool</TEXT>

<TITLE>Baba is you mod: Extrem's Mods Deluxe</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod Who here remembers extrem's mods? Y'know, that one modpack that had some ok-ish gimmicks at first but over time devolved into extrem's-collection-of-whatever-the-fuck-they-wanted-to-make? Well... Introducing Extrem's Mods Deluxe! This modpack takes some of the... less crappy features from extrem's mods and compiles them into one place! Now you can cut the crap and only have the good stuff. Isn't that neat?! This should be installed like any other baba is you mod. In your desired levelpack, place the "Lua" folder into the pack's folder. Note: "mods=1" must be in "world_data.txt" under the "[general]" header for the mod to take effect. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. what does act, refresher/refresh, update and returner/return do ACT: Does nothing on it's own but turns into "is" when the rule gets mimicked (e.g. "baba act blue" and "keke mimic baba" makes keke be blue, but not baba) RELOAD: Reloads the current level, updating KEEP rules. (Acts like "win" in the editor) RETURN: Returns to the map, updating KEEP rules (Acts like "win" in the editor) UPDATE: Updates the KEEP rules mid-level when stepped on by a "you" object. RELOADER and RETURNER both inherently have the RELOAD and RETURN properties respectively also why does return make a lua error when i use it well that error is become somebody *cough* me *cough* decided to break it by mistake thats a bug, will be fixed eventually also do you happen to know how to merge mods by any chance i mean i dont rly do it much but yeah. you pretty much just compare the code and basically put things that's in one but not the other into the other</TEXT>

<TITLE>BABA IS YOU LEVELPACK: TIMMY IS LITTLE 2  (TWO)!!</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod The second part of my levelpack that has only 10 downloads This levelpack contains 20 actual levels and 2 unbeatable levels (just to piss you off) With this levelpack, you get to: 1. Get trolled (of course) 2. Play actually (slightly tweaked by me) good levels I definitely haven't stolen from "Featured Levels" (BABABATTLE LEVEL BELONGS TO MANYTARO AND BABA IS BLOON LEVEL BELONGS TO TESLAPENGUIN1) 3. Contemplate pieces of art. 4. Find out about Baba is You Iceberg (belongs to some redditor, here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabaIsYou/comments/s5b209/the_baba_is_you_iceberg_has_e... ) 5. Make KEKE IS REAL (please do not (I beg you (okay you can do it but only one time))). 6. Defeat the Red Dragon (WIP) It takes around 20 minutes to do all that !YOU NEED BABA IS YOU GAME FIRST! (any copy will work, even if you... if you don't respect Hempuli's work that much) Download the file and drop "timmy_is_little_2" folder in the "Baba is you/Data/Worlds/" folder It should work.

<TITLE>Baba Is You Levelpack: Caves of Persistence</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable levelpack Every level starts by idling on a door to enter, but there are two ways to complete a level. Touching the flowers counts as a win. Collecting all the gems and exiting out a door allows travelling between two levels. This pack was sketched and started in 2021, but the map mechanic wasn't sorted out until two years later. It's a bit rough around the edges presentation-wise and there are a couple bugs in the hidden text, but it does serve as a good proof of concept for the navigation system.

<TITLE>Baba is Constant: Baba is You Modded Levelpack</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod This levelpack is a proof of concept for new modded word- CONSTANT. For those who don't care about figuring out what the property does yourself by playing the levels, below is an overview of the word: This mod manipulates the undo mechanics of the game. Objects that are constant become unaffected by the effects of undoing. This levelpack isn't very fleshed out, but I decided to just make 5 levels for now to cover a few interesting uses of the mechanic I see so far. However, the way the mod is implemented can be a bit un-intuitive if placed in certain situations, so if there's any more advanced modders out there who can figure out how to implement this idea better, free feel to do it. (im not much of a coder, this mod only uses 4 lines of code okay not anymore) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Cool, but WAY too difficult (any help on the second level?). I heard that ACB really likes this pa- [BANNED] this is sick nice</TEXT>

Glad to see you here There was cheese i had to fix btw, hope you dont mind the change to the level Oh! Yeah I saw that and I realized now that [ROT13] (xrxr pna whfg qvfnoyr grkg). Although uhh... can I suggest making a change that prevents that to be (vf xrxr naq synt abg jva) instead and not (xrxr arne grkg vf fgvyy)?- also I may have found a visual bug in the process of doing this- that doesnt fix the cheese lol, you dont need to make a question you can just straight up make a move statement also i assume the visual bug is the rule cancellation crosses?

Enjoy! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I haven't been able to fully finish any of the sub-worlds yet (the last few puzzles of each one are t o u g h ), but I have gotten the credits - And this is a nice variation on the usual mechanics! I dunno what mechanic I like the most. Everything is cool in their own ways, and the exploration of the mechanics seems to be really thorough. (Also in-edit, the music slaps and fits the tone some of the mechanics seem to imply) hehe thanks so much! i wanted pick mechanics that would interact in fun ways, so i spent a lot of time tweaking them, and this meant i had to scrap a lot of stuff that didnât fit as nicely. (and thanks for the compliment about the music !!! itâs one of my priorities, so iâm very glad i got it right) Nice puzzle! Kinda neat to see pure sokoban with a twist in Baba, also with a banger along with to play :) :D!!!!!!!</TEXT>

A friend gifted me a bundle that included this game and can't seem to find the Steam key. Do you not get one in that case? No games in the Racial Justice and Inequality bundle included steam keys. I love this game so much but it keeps crashing :( I'm running MacOS Big Sur. omg this game seems like alot of fun! if you mind me asking, is the windows version an x86 or x64 executable? If it's x64, it would mean a lot if support for either x86 or ARM64 on Windows, mainly so that it can be accessible to windows folks in different platforms. Incorrect, x86 means it'll work on 32 bit Intel-based systems and x64 means it works on 64 bit Intel-based systems. Neither is directly compatible with Arm64, both require emulation to be supported on Arm64-based Windows systems. This is so cute! It feels so rewarding to finish each level. Wonderful little gem! Soothing to listen and play while having a good amount of engaging puzzles Genuinely one of the most fun puzzle games out there. I'm not one for puzzle games but obviously this game won my heart don't have a Twitter, but who's a good dog btw This game is amazing. I thought I'd play a couple levels to try it out and 50 levels later, I'm in love! Holy crap. I got this in the racial justice bundle & thought it would be an allright game with cute dogs, but this is seriously one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Great job. Hello there ! I love this game, it's easy to play, colourful and can be watched or played at any age. My young daughter loves the crunching sound the dogs make. Having a great time with these cute puppers. Well done ! Hi there! I picked this up through the massive itch bundle and wanted to stop by to say how much I dig this game. It's a great take on the whole pipe/train/point connecting genre. Great visuals, great music loop, and I like the difficulty curve! Overall I enjoyed myself! I've attached my playthrough video if you're at all interested. Thanks for the great game. I seem to have run into a bug on level 80 which is stopping me from 100% the game though. One of the hams refuses to be eaten. Screenshot attached. If I can offer any further help, please let me know. Version #375164 Hey, thanks for the bug report! The Steam version has this issue fixed, along with controller support and 8 additional languages. Could you fix the non-Steam version? Or give Steam keys to people who got it from a bundle? I actually updated it to the same version the other day. Thanks! I must have downloaded it right before the update. Is this game on the Nintendo Switch? Yes! You could be able to find it on the eShop. There's even a demo! Fun game got it on steam $4.99, 20 stages in so far I like. Well done. =) Thanks! This game is pretty awesome :) I love the art style, the music, and the increasing scale of difficulty. I felt that the progression was great. Controlling the dogs was easy as well. Overall very cute and very fun!

Btw, if you create something cool with this set, tell about it in comments! :3 1. Unpack the set somewhere and import textures . 2. Create a material called M_Palette: 3. Import .OBJ Files. Set Import Rotation to 90 — 0 — 0 . I also recommend setting Import Uniform Scale to 4 so models' size will be somewhat comparable to real world scale. Next, set Import Material to true and Import Textures to false . Lastly, set Base Material Name to M_Palette. 4. A new material instance will appear. Rename it to MI_Palette_Emissive . You will probably need another material instance with zero intensity for powered-off tubes and wires. 5. Don't forget to disable Mip Maps for MagicaVoxel's palettes so it looks identically on different levels of graphic quality. I also recommend setting interpolation method to Nearest. Now you're all set! If you used an Import Uniform Scale equal to 4, then I recommend using these models with 50cm grid . Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. works on unity? It should</TEXT>

HIII I think theres an issue, I try to put pieces in the right up corner the game pauses, doesnt let me put the pieces and I lose as a result. I cannot press the home button either. Dont know if this is a me issue or what. Anyway I been following this game for a while, I returned to see whats up, I still like it very much :3 i can only get near 50 before i run out of room Could we get a windows download? Love the game!! Is there a reason why only arcade mode is unlocked? Plus this is good game; well done. really fun Love the new art style. Definitely made the game a lot harder too! Phew! Can't get anywhere near my old scores. Hey! Huge thanks for the support !! Glad you enjoyed it. It got prettier but the balance needs work, especially as now you cannot spend your gold in upgrades. I have been mega busy lately, I hope I can get back to it. If you have the time, could you give your take on the difficulty progression? Do the new piece variety is positive or negative? Again, thanks x1000 I think having mirrored pieces is great, allows for many more combinations. If anything, I do think that the ax and sickle blocks need more variety rather than just being an L for sickle and line for ax. It does get very hard very fast haha Love the art style! Hope you win! It has been awhile since there was an update. I hope everything is okay! Hey! thanks for checking out. We have been extremely busy with work. That said, there is a proper v2 in the pipeline (but in pause for over a month now). I hope we will be freer after September. uh-oh the leaderboard seems to have crashed Oh damn, I will try to take a look tomorrow. Sorry for the lack of support in the past month. No worries! Sometimes there's life priorities you need to sort out and it's a game I'm enjoying still! Hello! I hope life is treating you well. Just to let you know a new version is up! We re-took the development 2 weeks ago, I would love your opinion. Like someone commented 23 days ago, the tutorial is still broken. Welp, imma go figure the game out myself Hey it's been a while since an update so I hope you're all safe and it's just a loss of interest thing. Came back and I'm trying to break 60k Hey! thank you for writting to check on me :) I'm doing fine, I have been in the middle of a job change in the past weeks so I did not have the time to work on the project. I check the scores once in a while, you are rocking it, I would love to have the time to do the replay system so people could see your plays. Haha that would be really fun I'd probably flood the system when I come back I usually play many times in a row I would suggest you make reverse options for some of the pieces. Some of them have rotational symmetry but can't be flipped, so there should either be an option to flip them or there should be the reverse pieces added The tutorial seems broken? The part with "...an pick bonuses..." is off to the side and cut off so I can't read it, and I can't place the piece in the indicated spot. Wow that was really cool What a fantastic puzzle game! The new art is a whole different direction, it looks very good! Will say there is a visual bug when you get to the most zoomed out part, the terrain shapes outline that appears while lining it up to already placed terrain is off by several pixels. It is enough to make it difficult to actually see where you are putting your piece and cause incorrect placement. I love the new tree with building pieces, and the irregularity of the tree pieces makes it a challenge to try to line up, and keeps it looking very nice and organic, nice! The other gameplay changes make the game both easier and harder in a way. Its a bit harder to get enormous piles of gold until late game, but the new tree pieces give you a lot more life to stack up. Its a neat change! Also the change in beginning shape has completely broken the tutorial just fyi haha Not sure if this was on purpose but the newest update has it so that when you click on a card the piece stays with you after it should be destroyed instead of yanking the piece away, at least for me. Also the tutorial still says you cannot rotate buildings even though you can now. I added that tutorial but did not give enough love yet... Yes, now pieces dont move while on the hand, as people complained of the yanking. I apologize if that came off as me being part of that! I've been told I can sound critical when I'm going into detail and it's something I'm working on and its harder in text that doesnt convey tone. I didn't have too much of a problem with yanking! I do prefer the method of being fast enough to hold a piece to stay in just a bit longer, though because its a slight skill based thing. My issue with the yanking was more the previous system made it very difficult to know what the next card was as at that point both the card being yanked and the next card were usually under the deletion line so if you werent paying attention to the pattern it can lead to losing a few cards till you get back in rhythm. It was a bigger issue when the cards couldnt be picked up with just a click instead of clicking and holding because that method took too much time and you would lose the piece you tried to save yourself with before you could place it, so it was really hard to save yourself No worries, it was a valid argument and friends that tested also pointed it out :) I still dont love the return, but it is less punishing for nothing (holding a piece is already punishing enough) ok bug i mentioned in the dev log, putting it here for more attention, the one where the card icon instead of displaying with the mouse for placement it shoots to the next card falling making it not placable, its STILL in the game and with the fact that the cards stay persistently in your hand, getting this bug makes the hotkey 1 unusable for the rest of the game in addition to the game not being playable and because its still "in hand" it makes picking up other cards REALLY weird where it generates a blank card on pick up so you lose hearts despite placing cards. It is now game breaking if this bug occurs ajdhkaksfjks????? what is going on the game is too big for the window, like the whole game box that displays the game widget I think that might be an itch.io thing, still odd. Looks fine in full screen though. But now I need to get my grubby hands on the update and im already ooo'ing and aaa'ing over the art and the new card pick up stuff. I am SO CHARMED by the new combo village and wheat piece. Its so fun and i love the odd shape and the windmill but it's got a whole bunch more placement options like art to shape it went from my least fave piece to like my most, it looks SUPER good. Also the map in contrast to last update is MASSIVE. The card play area is already enormous but the deletion line is still pretty far bellow the actual line so i think you could get some insane highscores on this update. Though! With some of the nerfs to the wheat shapes where there doesnt seem to be as many (at all? maybe, Im not super sure after just one game) of the large squares so point racking for the wheat is slower and I think that works well in conjunction to the farm coin upgrade where it was really OP before to it being a lot more reasonable. Also I LOVE the card pick up system where it kind of remembers where the card would be falling if you drop the piece so you cant just keep a card indefinitely like on some previous versions, though it does seem like if you keep dropping it and picking it up as it should be deleting the card stays the 1 hotkey even though other cards are passing it technically. It's a bit of a change! I like it a lot though Oh ! in addition to the devlog maybe needing a check (incorrect dates, two identical version numbers despite them being clearly different updates, unlike the hotfix updates youve done) the rankings may need a reset (edit: clarifying the like version highscore list not the alltime) because I feel like the highscores get SUPER affected with this most recent update Thanks for all these corrections. * The scores are still separated per patch (the last one was grouped only because there were not that many weekly plays at this moment). It is normal there will be an inflation in points until things get stable, I will add a way of navigating previous patches. * the new way of dealing with the drop piece needs to be fixed, I will look at the hotkey at the same time. * all blocky pieces were turned into more tetris-like, as the puzzle was not that interesting with them. Maybe i'll remove the piece stacking to make it more interesting. I dont know what you think. * i will check that breaking bug you mention, plus the resolution in the next patch (probably this weekend) Excited about the new art updates! So far its a lot easier to tell what squares are occupied than the other art! Rotation is also exciting and I'm looking forward to seeing how that changes how I lay out everything. Currently it looks like something happened with the playmap where its larger than previous? The header with the level stats and the box for the card deletion cover the map pretty significantly by level 8 almost the whole top two rows are completely covered by the header and around 6 squares in the bottom left are covered. Theres some other smaller bugs on the last dev log btw if you havent seen those yet! Theyre just little bugs that came up with the sheer amount of times ive replayed it, and arent entirely easy to replicate but have happened more than once Hey! Thanks as always for the feedback. Sorry about the map size, I am looking for a way to make it adaptative to work also in mobile but so far it only got worse. I saw you other post, I will get back to bug fixing once we get a solid art identity. Yeah its tricky to design something for two different platforms at once so I think it's more than understandable. And take time on the bug post! None of them are really game breaking, but just stuff I caught over time After play it a bit the new update has changed the gameplay just a bit. So the rotations have been great in terms of castles and I'm looking forward to maybe trees getting to rotate (not a big deal though because only one tree piece has any change with rotation). However the building for the villages hasnt really changed at all because of how the coin piece plays, the one that is both farm and village. Because the village part cuts the piece in half, and cannot be placed adjacent to village pieces unless done so vertically with nothing on either side of the piece its placed above or below, the playstyle of this piece has completely unchanged in that the best configuration is placing them in a line straight down with nothing adjacent so as not to cut off farm land pieces from eachother. There also in addition to the map coverage there seems to be less area for cards to remain active, so the window of playing the cards is smaller than the previous version. Ever since I found this game it has been my go to as a time waster while I talk with friends. I love it! Its fantastic watching it evolve and get better and better over time! Hey! So glad you like it, as you are one of the regular players, do you have any deep insights about the game? Things you would add or remove? Things you look forward to? Things you dislike? Ah the big thing that comes to mind for me is mostly just that there are no mirror version of asymmetrical pieces, but that's just me being used to tetris haha yeah!! the small s pieces get me all the time because i get s spaces left over and then realize i had it set up in the wrong direction and i just have to fill it in with singles and shame I don't think I could say enough it's still really cool to come back to this and see it change over time. I love the new piece variety and I like the upgrades as both the random aspect as well as the counter to the max grass playstyle. After playing a bit, the randomness of the upgrades does need a bit of a counter because at current its entirely possible to upgrade to the next level too fast and not be able to afford any upgrades at all because only one or two coins were on the map, especially at the start and having bad upgrades overall can change a run drastically where I finish with potentially thousands of points in the difference between a run where I could afford nothing but hearts or coins themselves to one where I very early got a farm upgrade and coasted off that the whole run. I love the introduction of the randomness because it makes the runs feel very different but it seems too heavily reliant on rng at current. It also would be neat to have a ui element that tracks purchased upgrades so I know what I've bought over time, and the prompts are so fast its sometimes unclear how much of an upgrade I really got, if it was just an addition of points from what was already on the map, or if all the tiles of that in the future of have a point increase. Potentially an upgraded ui element for that where the visual of placing them might be different? Everything aside, it's super exciting to see new things I hadn't even considered yet get added in and get to try them out. oh additionally I'm not sure what changed but being able to afford upgrades really is only an issue in the very early game because it's not uncommon to have hundreds of excess gold by the end of a run with no hope of ever spending it all. Oooo big update. First thing, your new picking up method broke your new tutorial. The cards no longer stay in your hand to then place with a click you have to hold it down which causes delays in rotating. I love all the new pieces but the system to pick up pieces is very jarring and I was frequently dropping pieces when I meant to place them and in the delay to drag a piece over and try and rotate it the piece would be gone. The hotkeys are the only way to persistantly keep a piece in hand but if you click an invalid place it snaps out of your hand it makes keeping track of whats on my number 1 key incredibly difficult. It seems too like since the area is a lot smaller for the cards that it gets really fast, well, really fast. I do like the new piece varieties, though, and it's neat to make new patterns to accommodate for all the different pieces. The UI also looks very clean, and the new upgrades are super interesting. Putting the lives in the upgrades is also an interesting change and makes choosing which cards to prioritize very different Uhhhh the rankings also seem to be broken. It doesnt recognize me as AreYouSavvy and its not putting another score on the board Which is especially odd with the option to have it only show the highscores for the current version, unless it hasnt been upgraded to match yeah playing it more the hotkeys and speed would be ok if the click hold card thing was put back and the card didnt snap away when you place it wrong its very frustrating to have the piece and try and place it four times and then the cards whisk away so you don't know what youre holding anymore becaue the card kept dropping because your mouse was a pixel off This is to say like every big update im like AHHHHHH CHANGE, but then i keep playing it and im like oh it's pretty good actually lol Just arrived from work, thanks x 1000 for the feedback. I will do a quick-fix tonight for the most critical of the issues you found. Ok, I am pushing a hotfix with your comments: Now you should be able to play as before but also do drag&drop, I also fixed the scoreboard and added a small line showing the piece connected to the cursor. Let me know what you think. Thanks again! Buxxy if youre out there like, how. I Filled the map and wasnt even close Max grass is broken, my friend. grass>trees>farms>houses>castles yeah see i was maxing out the space for literally everything but grass, and as soon as i went back to my og strat of taking up as little space as possible my highscore immediately went up lol Wow, that is seriously impressive. Not sure I can do that. My strategy is simply to focus on making one type as big as possible. :) Hey! Hope your days have been good between the updates. Found a visual bug where if I am rotating the smaller wheat field at the same time I'm hotkey picking up another piece (and I think mid click on the mouse so it wasnt fully dropped into place) it turns the visual on the card for the field to 500% of it's og size and so doesnt even fit on its own card lmao. It's not super easy to replicate but thought you ought to know! Thank you for pointing the bug out, I will add it to the backlog. I added a fix to it but please let me know if you see it again, as I was not able to reproduce it myself. BTW, I added you to the game acknowledgements, your feedback really helps! Hey thanks I'm happy to be here! :) So I love the added clarity of highlighting the grouped areas as you're adding a piece to the puzzle, because I didnt realize the full area of points for some of the pieces (like the towers that are three squares of points even though they only occupy one square) but in the late game its pretty laggy the areas are so large that adding to my landmass after 12000 points gets very very difficult because of screen tears and drops in framerate so I can miss cards altogether. I don't think its anything to do with internet connection, i think we may just be reaching the limitations of what the browser format can optimally process at one time I do get over 320 mbps download and upload speed so I don't think that has anything to do with it and since I dont think this actually runs off of my computer I dont think my comp stats would have anything to do with it (though I do have 32gb ram for the record so it's not shabby lol) I think its something about having to process that display update as I hover the piece in different areas Oh you are absolutely right! I did not test it for higher levels, hot-fixed for now, I will find a better solution later on. Still here even on the non-update days, lol I can tell you I hope the next update that rolls out includes a pause screen that has the ability to reset your mode in it. But honestly the pause would be great because I work in a call center currently so I play between callers and it hurts my heart to just have to abandon my game and let it run till it just ends hi! you have a pause/exit button on the top right (or you can also pause with ESC key). \o/ BIG EXCITEMENT. PAUSE BUTTON POG IN THE CHAT LOL OH BIG HYPE ON THE TITLE CARD TOO IT LOOKS SO GOOD THAT PERSPECTIVE ITS KILLER Something's up for the arcade mode after the update. Unless you meant to make it way harder it seems like there are some cases where it drops two cards when it means to drop one/maybe keybinding isnt resetting the card drop timer because my cards are coming in so fast by only level 8 that its difficult to see which ones I even have Also with adding the new mode next might be that pause screen because i currently have to refresh the whole page to switch modes LOVE the puzzle mode system. Very handy. It does take some of the challenge away but it more obviously shows that it gets very difficult in the late 2700s scores for the current map because you run out of room. On arcade I was trying to minimize mistakes to see if I could still get more but currently the way I think the top score was made was being very good at not making mistakes and not losing any health until that point and building their pieces optimally better than I currently am, but the map does get really cramped at that point lol The puzzle mode is also missing a more complete "end" because currently you just cant place anymore pieces and you just refresh lol Ending: for now it was just a sandbox test, I will use this to build a given challenge, and have a build-path with per-level-up decisions (e.g. buy piece/lose something/expand map). Refresh: You have a little cross on the top-right corner to go back to the main menu. Thank you as always for being so reactive :D, if you have anything you consider would improve the game, I am eager to read about it. It's just honestly really cool to be able to see these updates come out and what new stuff has been added and it feels like in a small bit I'm part of it lol. I'm very excited to see puzzle mode grow and new challenges being added in. I keep thinking about that campaign mode and I almost don't want to suggest things for it because I kind of want to be surprised when it comes out. Done in this hotfix. Again, thanks! Good catch! I added a hotfix. Last night's patch was a bit rushed, I will start spacing the patches a bit more. Love the concept! maybe the pieces falls a little bit too fast for some peoples, maybe a good idea in order to buff the accessibility would be an easy mode and/or an infinite lives mode Anyway, great work! Really enjoyed the game! Took me a couple rounds to figure out the tree->straw->house->castle progression, but as soon as I did, I was cruising Hey here for the new update again lol excited about the new leaderboard, it looks like it doesn't update if you make a highscore right away you have to close it and reopen it at the end to see it reflect the changes. I also think I almost prefer the clicking method when it starts getting fast because its hard to keep up with which card is attached to which keybind because they all shift when a card reaches the bottom. Still! it's pretty handy in the early game and definitely speeds that part up if you want it to since using the last card makes another immediately appear also see you reshuffled the early cards a bit lol :P Hey! I see you are first, congratz! What do you think of the new difficulty curve? Is there anything you would like to have ? I really like it so far I think I at base really enjoy the concept of like collecting each piece together, and something that could work for like scaling difficulties or maybe in the story mode is having more types. It's been this most recent update that its more effectual to focus on spreading out more than just the land, before I was racking in points mostly from having a ring of free land around everything and going for the single and s pieces to get as many points as possible, but recently the other pieces like the forest and the wheat are more useful because each piece gives points with the exception of the heart trees, so I usually have my houses and castles grouped together very tightly and have wheat land and trees everywhere else, especially given how rare some of the better castle pieces feel. A point curve between them would probably be good, like land being worth less and castles being worth more. I also think the keybind system can take further looking into because using keys is definitely easier but it makes it hard when I dont know what piece im going to pick up where knowing whats next is where i can plan ahead, because unlike tetris the pieces you have are even more important because land can only be places on water and the others only placed on land and then you want to group them by type so its really important to know what piece youre placing because it drastically changes where they go. oh, lol an s piece in the other direction too as like a very minor thing lmao OH, even more pressing a pause screen lol yoooo i love this game relaxing and intense at the same time i wonder if some sort of "creative" mode would work, where you can build a kingdom to your heart's content? Hey, glad you liked it! We are seeing which game mods we will work on, and a sandbox one would be East to add, maybe with some classical city builder gameplay. hi made it to level 9 really fun game! really polished and fun concept. I echo other high scorers in potentially adding hotkeys though, since my right hand kind of hurts after playing it hahaha Hi there! leaderboards and hotkeys are online! LOVE the feel of the new large houses block, it feels really good to place after getting those house and farm combo pieces so I can connect all my houses together Also the resizing to fix that bit that was covering the corner was a good fix and looks good! Great concept, keep it up! I was able to reach level 12, then the block fell quicker than I could click. glad you liked it! level 12 is crazy good! What was your score? I forgot, but I played it again and reached level 12 with a score of 12518. Would be cool if there was a way to select the blocks by keys (maybe Q and E to cycle through them or something). Then you don't have to move the mouse as much. Or maybe a Tetris like system where you always select the first and can hold one block. With small adjustments for mobile devices, I can imagine this being a really cool mobile game as well. Again, great work :-) Excellent! Another serious scorer also recommended hotkeys. I have it in the todo list for some quick testing. Thanks again for playing, i will probably do a few weeks of experiments and see how well it goes... for now working on an online leaderboard to see the global scores. very hype for a leaderboard, honestly lol my competitive spirit soars Hi! leaderboards and hotkeys are online! you know an idea that would be a bit different for a game like this would be to have the cards fall down to your hand of like four cards each bound to a key (wasd) that lets you select from the different hand slots and then if you dont use a card before the next one is dropped you lose a heart, that way its getting keybinds in instead of clicking and picking up pieces and you get to keep the feel of the challenge being in trying to beat the falling speed of the cards? Spitballing because I've actually been playing this since I commented and was thinking on good solutions for a while cause a tetris keep one use one style would completely take the challenge away unless you were to rework the heart and card speed system into something else altogether so fun Great game! I love it! Awesome! I never would have thought about a Tetris / Builder game! Good concept. The story mode would come out really good if you end up finishing it Love the new tree assets! I forgot before but it looks like in the higher levels (around level 10 I think, it gets pretty fast at that point so it's hard to say) the container for the destruction line covers the bottom left portion of the map, not a lot at level ten but by level 13 or so its a good five or six squares. I've just been doing guesswork in that area but maybe resizing something could make it so it's not obscured? Great concept and superb execution!</TEXT>

Only problem we came across was with the card puzzle, it didn't give us an item at first even though the cards were in the correct spots, after replacing all of them it finally worked though. Thanks for the feedback! We'll try to take a look at that to see if we can figure out what might have happened. Thx you for your game! We played it with freinds and we love it! Thanks! We appreciate it! Hope you look forward to the final release later this year. Is there any way I can play this game alone? I'm sorry, but the game is designed around there being 2-4 players as there are some puzzles that require at least two players and communicating with each other. The online service provider we use also doesn't allow the same computer to connect twice. Theoretically if you have two computers you could host on one and join with the other and switch between the two when needed, but I can't promise the best experience with that.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Puzzle Sigma</TITLE>
<TEXT>Play as mathematical operators and build equations to solve puzzles. By Jon Topielski (Programming), Thoof (Art) and Beardy (Music, SFX) Made for GMTK Game Jam 2021. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Add a linear algebra level so my monkey brain can learn algebra. I'm not asking what the sigma I need to beat level 100 but it is missing :( You may even add higher level maths! You may make a university math game or even physics one with moles and atoms! Very fun, and just hard enough to be challenging but easy enough that my smooth brain could enjoy it. (the times symbol makes me very concerned though) why do they look like that Very fun concept but a little too easy. Its incredible for a jam game though. If you ever plan to revisit the game or its concept in the future, it would be cool if you could add more ways to count such as division, exponents, square roots, etc. Also a level where you need to manage multiple playable characters would be fun. And a menu, its annoying not being able to store your progress anywhere. Also what happened to the multiplication symbol at the end? There were only minus and plus symbols left...did multiplication die? The lore should definitely be expanded if you make any kind of sequel. we need more, please Beat the game! Very fulfilling! Level 12 is quite hard. Can someone help me - - = + This level tooks me a lot of time to some too hey thanks! i used a tilemap as the "source of truth" for all the blocks and for all input, i updated the tilemap. for example, if the player presses left, you check the tilemap to see if the player tile can move left or not. the game was completely playable with placeholders until very close to the end and looked something like this: what you see in the final product is just a "dumb" UI layer on top of the placeholders and i use tweening to move the tile positions from the current one to the next one. you need to be able to encapsulate any given board state in some kind of data structure, like a 2d array. then, whenever the player moves, update the board state and maintain an array of the past board states. if the player presses undo, simply revert back to the last state. similarly for reset, go back to the first board state. for example, you can have an array of objects where each object looks like { coordinates: (0, 4), tile_id: 2 }. whenever a change happens on the board, you can create a new entry (a new array) and capture all the active objects on the board. if you ever undo, you need to grab the previous array of active objects and be able to interpret it and update the board. Thanks a lot! This is really helpful and I havent really seen anyone else give such a good tutorial on this with actual collision I finally beat this. I seriously love your games so much, from the funny NPCs to the strategy games. thanks!! you tried so many and it means a lot that you kept coming back :D It's beautiful! Honestly I'm a math nerd who draws numbers as living creatures in math equations as a way to remember them and hand them on my wall, this is an inspirment great game but the mathematical operators look. kinda terrifying it's probably the shocked facial expressions/mouths very unique mechanics :> nice level 10 is impossible. not even its possible how did you make a math game thats actually fun i call hax Yeah lol Nice game! I especially like the concept of locking certain numbers behind the locks, making you have to open that, then grab the number to make the proper equation. This could do really good as a full game Awesome game! I really appreciate that the few "gentle nudge" hints I used were in the form of questions. Definitely got me on the right track while staying as vague as possible. The actual puzzles were really good as well and did a great job of leading me to discover all of the ways each element could interact without directly telling. Great mechanic! I especially like how the puzzles combine math with geometry. You definitely had me with level 12, but the hints were pretty useful. The last couple of levels are quite tricky, but I did managed to beat the game. Really coolâ¦ just added to my collection! Would you like to join Creactivity #1 ? Really good concept and fun little game! Really cool concept ! Really well executed ! Good game. Cool, I played back during the jam voting and for me the levels got frustrating complex quickly, the pacing was more manageable now I thought! when are you going to add derivatives? =) Just AWESOME! Keep it up! very clever game...super creative the last 3 lvls killed me though lol Puzzle Sigma (Full Game) omg this game was infuriating for me as a dyslexic XD But this video is so awesome! first one I have had edited for me which is wild, one of my favorite videos by far! Was fun to watch you two play to the end! Had some good chuckles. Btw, you played the harder version before the order of operations was fixed so extra props! GOOD Fantastic game, perhaps the concept couldn't be taken too far without becoming tedious, but as a short game it's excellent. Still, I'm sure someone more mathematically inclined than me would love to solve some complex puzzles in this. Excellent and satisfying sound effects, too. Go Godot <3 Very good game, even for me who hates maths, but "Z" doesn't do anything on AZERTY keyboards. EDIT: Nevermind, it just doesn't do what I thought it would, but it works. Add division Inconsistent rules for how blocks move through structures (I solved the lockless one by rotating through a wall where before and after that had not been possible) and an unintelligible method of arithmetic. The music was repetitive. The art style was wonderful and funny, properly cartoonish. I would recommend a more descriptive and clear tutorial, if not a reworking of your parenthetical use. Every time I see 1+2-3 in a simple math game, I want to say ((1+2)-3)=0, not (1+2)+(2-3)=2. say, further in the future, it becomes possible to have a string of numbers with random values as long as 4 signs long. A+B+C+D+E (4 +'s). It is natural for the human brain to associate the methodology with left-to-right bracketing, two at a time. ((((A+B)+C)+D)+E) Please come away with thIS knowing it comes from an amateur critic and a mathematically inclined mind. Best of luck with your future endeavors. I may have missed something, and correct me if I am wrong, but to me it seems like you used two examples where parentheses are unnecessary. I do agree that the music is somewhat repetitive, although I have never really encountered a jam game where the music isnt repetitive in a similar way. Reviewing non-repetitive music as a positive seems more reasonable than reviewing repetitive music as a negative seems more reasonable for me. I would be pleased if you were to name a game jam game with non-repetitive music. Please come away with thIS knowing it comes from an amateur critic and a mathematically incompetent mind. Best of luck with your future endeavors. Solid game. I suspect the "intended solution" wasn't always the one I found, given that I passed several levels without unlocking all the locks. Congrats on making top 20 in the GMTK Jam! I wanted to reach out to ask if anyone on the dev team would be interested in participating in an interview about your experience during the jam? Interviews are conducted over Discord and presented live on Twitch . Messaged on Discord. Really clever game. Had some nice brain teasers. Really great idea! Too bad I am stumbling just now over it. thank you made me relize how much of a dumbass i am This game is super fun. Cool concept, and I love math so that's a real bonus.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Puzzle Ecstasy</TITLE>
<TEXT>The difficulty is high in this puzzle action game. Be warned, this game requires not only thinking but action skills. Will you experience the puzzle ecstasy? Update 2023-07-01 23:16 I swapped levels 2-4 and 2-5 and changed both of the levels a bit because I like it better that way. Also added an alternate restart method. The original release is archived here . Information How to play Use arrows to play. Don't forget up and down. Remember Sylvie's special dance: hold left and right + press down, it will reset the level. If it does not work (maybe your keyboard doesn't like you holding three keys at once) then try the R key instead. Secret techniques I won't tell you any, discover them yourself. Secret buttons Press number keys to change your level if you want to. Type the tilde (~) character to go to the final world. This world has the ultimate levels. Go here at your own risk. Type the tilde (~) character again while in the final world to advance to the next level. You can advance to the ending screen and complete the game quickly this way. Game jam note I submitted this game to the Game Breaker's Toolkit Jam #9 , which is a jam for bad games, but I think it is a good game. I submitted it to get more attention for the game. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. game completed (i struggled a lot more with the first few levels than anything else, i feel especially world 3 mostly leaned into action rather than puzzles which im much better at) What a cute but challenging puzzle game! I didn't understand the rules of the game at first and got stuck at 1-2, but it was a lot of fun to learn the game controls and object rules through trial and error! Especially when I noticed the release of 3-3, I really felt ecstasy and screamed heroically. Also, burning the blue cat was immoral, but the way it was burning was kind of cute. it is a lovely game! it was hard but i somehow did it. level 3-3 was one of the greatest plot twists i ever seen incredible work as always The puzzles are incredibly clever. It's very satisfying every time you solve one. The game is very relaxing despite the difficulty. I made it to level 5 and it took me a shamefully long time. I only solved puzzle 4 by chance ^^ But thanks to the level select option I will certainly try to continue where I left off at some point. you must be a puzzle and action master to complete this ! i ended like the main game process in task manager and it made it lose some of the sky box on refresh difficult action challenge! Graphics: [ X X - - X X - ] Visuals: [ X X - X - - X ] Action: [ X X X - - X - ] Good idea,the sensitivity of the boxes to pushing could be stronger though.Like you should need to push it for some time before it moves,cause now i accidentally push them. I understand so much in 2d game space as a result of Sylvie. i wasn't sure about puzzle ecstasy. i immediately felt action ecstasy, and i want to believe you can have the same confidence for puzzles. certainly struggling and playing can accomplish an understanding, even if to do so i need to pretend a current understanding already is enough that i donât need to go somewhere else. being stuck in a puzzle as like being stuck not finding any game to play because you want it to work without bringing up something else. my best think times happen when i keep tying in other things, i was skeptical but maybe using a way of practicing incorporations is similar to using a way of practicing actions. in practicing actions, may not want to use pacing strategies incase they don't work and lose chunks of time that you don't like to, and may be okay often losing bits of time in a unpaced session where getting started again isn't a too big amount of time. was thinking the ecstasy is only in the latter but either way can reach the excitement that keeps up yourself anyway, puzzle ecstasy is possible. another place i don't understand falls, although i can't say this is really a finished thought? <-(scary q mark) probably due for another activity, currently on level 8 which i forgot the answer to lol (edit now 14) am stuck on level 2. feel like im missing something I don't know what you tried so far, but you need to stack two crates to reach the floating flame. Remember to always fight with your full strength. i think it is a good game</TEXT>

<TITLE>PuzzleGraph</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux PuzzleGraph is a tool for creating simple typical computer game puzzles and then analyzing and visualizing their state space. Setup and connect puzzle elements like gates, toggles, pressure plates and boulders. See the state space of the puzzle visualized, including solution paths, dead ends and fail states. If you use PuzzleGraph - either purposefully or just messing around - please tell me about your experience. And I'd love to see puzzles you make with it, and potentially include them with the distribution if you want! PuzzleGraph is open source and the source code is available here under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. PuzzleGraph on macOS now supports Catalina and Big Sur and supports retina resolution. All the node and edge types now have tooltips to make it more clear what exactly they do and there is a help screen with an overview of all the element types. I also added three new puzzle elements; the one way edge , the blockable hazard edge , and the ball track edge . Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Not sure if you have ever seen puzzlescript, but it would be super cool to get this to work for a game made in puzzlescript. This is super interesting. Glad you find it interesting! I'm familiar with PuzzleScript, though I haven't tried to make something with it myself. If someone were to make a state space visualizer for PuzzleScript, I'd certainly find it interesting too! But I'm not sure it's viable. Consider a very simple 5 x 5 room with a character and two pushable crates. There's 25 walkable tiles that the character and each crate can be on, so that's 25 * 25 * 25 = 15625 states. Divide by two (the factorial of 2) if the crates are interchangeable, but that's still over 7000 states for a really simple puzzle. Most PuzzleScript levels have more walkable tiles and more interactive elements. A 6 x 6 tiles room with a character and 3 crates would be 36 * 36 * 36 * 36 / 6 = 279936 states. It grows exponentially and most PuzzleScript levels probably have millions or billions of states, if not even more. It's intractable to calculate such a large state space. There's a reason PuzzleGraph represent rooms as abstract nodes instead of supporting tile based levels. Now, there was some researcher who found a way to reduce the state space for classic Sokoban, but the method was quite complex and also quite tailored to the specific rules of Sokoban. I'm not sure it generalizes to the extreme flexibility of PuzzleScript. In any case it would be a highly complex research problem to solve, if it's possible. If someone attempts it, good luck to them! Do you have a link to that research? It sounds very interesting! Unfortunately I can't find the research paper I referred to (I read it many years ago) but if you search on Google Scholar for 'sokoban "state space"' there are a lot of papers covering the topic in various ways. why is mine 10p and not 4k Sorry, I don't understand the comment. sorry i meant reselution. Ok, I assume by 10p you mean 1080p. The application is supposed to run as a window that you can resize and can make fill your entire screen if you want, at native resolution. Is this not the case for you? yes. Cool tool! Glad you like it! I discovered this tool in 2014-16 I think, and I still use it. Itâs a really useful thing, I teach it to my students, for LevelDesign. Iâd gladly add more features like Enemy defeat condition or achievement/mechanic unlocking zones, more file formats, etc. Let me know if you ever want me to bring some support, ok? Merry Xmas! Hi, merry Xmas! I'm really happy you find PuzzleGraph useful to use for your teaching. PuzzleGraph is open source, and you're welcome to make a clone of the repository and add features there. I'd follow that with interest! If I end up liking them, I can roll them into the original distribution, and either way you can distribute your version yourself. The source code repository is here (in Mercurial format): https://hg.sr.ht/~runevision/puzzlegraph Cheers! Hi, I really love the concept and I was wondering if the states panel was interactive in some way ? Since it shows which state you're in on the state tree while you're playing, I was wondering if you could click on a state node and it shows what the state is in the left panel. It'd be awesome to "debug" puzzles while designing them to see potential unwanted states. edit: ok I saw it was in your todo list. Definitly let me know when it's implemented! Is there a way to delete nodes after placing them? Certainly! You can select a node or an edge by clicking on it, and then pressing Delete or Backspace on the keyboard to delete it. Thanks!! Iâm an idiot, didnât think about that. I made a small video on PuzzleGraph for my YT channel, I love it as a tool to analyze dungeon-like level ideas even before whiteboxing them. Good job!! Hi, Very interesting. Is it possible to know which framework was used to create this puzzle game? Thanks Hi, PuzzleGraph is made with Unity. Thanks for you reply. I have used Libgdx and Game Maker in the past and tried Unity for a while but did not like it much although it looks very powerful. When trying to open it in macOS Big Sur, now I get this error: "PuzzleGraph.app" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. macOS cannot verify if this app is free of malicious software. Chrome downloaded this file today at 12:37 PM from runevision.itch.io. Yes, macOS does that for all software that doesn't have certificates. Read here how to open it anyway: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-dev... By the way, I just uploaded a new version which has retina support and this should look better, so try to redownload before you try to open again. Thanks, now if I could run the application. You still can't run it? Did you follow the steps in the link I posted? What issue are you hitting now? it worked well for me Oh good, glad to hear it! Hello, The application does not work in macOS Big Sur. I uploaded a new build which should support Catalina and Big Sur and which also implements retina support. Hey, this is extremely cool! Is there any chance of getting another upload of the source code? I'd love to play around with this a bit if possible. Thanks! Right, thanks for the reminder. Since Bitbucket stopped Mercurial support, the source is now available here: https://hg.sr.ht/~runevision/puzzlegraph thank you! Ah the mac build needs to updated to 64 bit as the last two versions of macos dont support 32bit apps I know this reply comes a bit late, but there's now a new version which is 64 bit and supports Catalina and Big Sur. Very funny and interesting tool. One thing that you should consider is an option to turn off states calculations. If you make more complicated puzzle, the game just starts to slow down and freezes eventually due to enormous number of calculations computer has to make to compute all different states the game might have. And my own puzzle if someone wants to try. Hi. Glad you like the tool! Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm not actively developing the tool further (though it's open source if anyone want to give it a go themselves). Since you're sharing your puzzle: You can choose Menu > Open Puzzle Folder and see the text files for your puzzles. If you post the text content somewhere, other people will be able to save it as text files and open it locally in their own PuzzleGraph application. :) This is really excellent. It's a fantastic tool for learning puzzle design as a discipline. I notice that doors, if they start open, will close when triggered by a lever, but not a button or a plate. I wish they closed for any trigger, that would make possible a lot of interesting puzzle mechanics. Having one action that is both advantagous and disadvantagous to the player in different ways is a really important idea in puzzle design. I really hope you're able to take this idea further, I'm loving it. Looks really interesting and useful but unfortunately only for really basic puzzles. Suffers from two things that I noticed * Interchangeability of players and balls - maybe one player is too big to go through crawlspace or something like that, or only one type of balls lets you go through hazard * Hardcoded rather than customizable puzzle elements, that feel quite arbitrary, especially path elements. I think, it would be better if you could select for each path (or have some library of presets), whether you can see/shoot (in each directions), what types of players can go, what types of balls can be carried/pushed etc. etc. Also I haven't found a way to reverse direction of stuff like steps and walls Great tool. I'm looking for ideas to make games and this has my mind racing! I saw this a couple years ago, and was so glad to see source come out to muck around. Was reading through it and came across something funky though. Sure enough: Just thought I'd drop that here in case you are after (visual) bug reports. Regardless. Incredible project. Good find! To be honest I haven't tested a lot with multiple player characters so am not too surprised. You say you discovered this by looking through the code. What specifically tipped you off? Hey, awesome to see you read these comments! I've been enjoying spending a lot of time just reading/rewriting/mucking around with the code and seeing ways this project could be taken further. In this case, it seems to be due to the merging of states. As you know, states nodes are created, and then compared to existing states, to see if it's actually an already existing one. In the case of 2 players (other than when they can't reach each other), every state (other than when they are in the same node), involve an exact replica, in which the two players are switched. This visual bug is caused due to the state in which the players are where you'd expect, having been replaced with the state in which they are switched. The ideal solution in my mind is not so tightly linking specific 'movables' to each state, but instead merely linking the concept (or definition) of that movable to the state, and then evaluating which particular movable is most appropriate to animate to the new location. I really like the way this gives immediate feedback to the designer. It might not be the best way to actually design a well-crafted puzzle, but you can just adjust the variables around bit by bit and instantly know if you've destroyed the intended path through the puzzle or opened up a bunch of unintended ones. I've never been able to find the video of the talk since I watched it originally, but I remember Marc Ten Bosch (Meigakure dev) talking a bit about state spaces and how he tries to design puzzles that create large state spaces with a short goal path, the notion being that these puzzles are easy to solve, but only if you know the solution. This kind of visualization would be pretty useful if that's your design philosophy, especially if it was integrated right into your dev tools (assuming your game lends itself well to being analyzed as a state space - grid based movement and all that). Nice game bro, thanks The program doesn't work for my computer for some reason, it opens but its black and nothing happens I'm sorry to hear that. Are you using Windows, Mac or Linux? What version? I'm using Windows 10 Are you having the same issue with other applications or games made with Unity, or with any games in general - or only with PuzzleGraph? Only Puzzle Graph. But I got a new pc and it works on this one? Weird. I am currently messing around with it and there is a problem with one way passages, they don't work. I can still come back. Also Door that starts open doesn't seem to let me go through either. Hi. I'm afraid I don't know where to start with regard to the issue you had first, but I'm happy to hear it works on your new PC! About the puzzle related issues would it perhaps be possible for you to record videos of them so I can see the exact puzzle configuration that triggers it? Thanks! Great work / superb value. Rugged quality work for solid puzzle game construction in any dimension including virtual to physical. Great application potential for demands of emerging platforms.</TEXT>

I'm playing the latest puzzle as a guest but Im running into a problem with the easy peasy solution- it won't let me edit the label?? Any help with "Roger must die?" We have a hint system integrated into the puzzle channel of our discord server - you can use the syntax "clue for kill [x]" https://discord.com/invite/GshQKAEY4P?_kx=_NEZvoNKZfV4cXEX5IMHEg%3D%3D.VxpbwG Having issues logging in despite several code resends, unfortunately. ';w;' Gave this a go a bit ago and had a good time! The web version of this seems to be very broken, but I'm intrigued enough to download the full thing. Hopefully that will be... less broken. ð³ Hey GreedyRadish -- the standalone version is definitely more stable this month. The WebGL version is having some difficulty connecting our databases (not sure if a change Itch side, or a problem with our code (most likely latter!), but we're trying to diagnose the issue at the moment. Apologies for the issues here! is there a way to view previous puzzles The free/web-player version of Puzzletrunk always just features the current month's puzzle -- to access the archive and all past puzzles, you'll need to purchase the game. Hope this helps! Thanks! Where Can I buy it? The login method is not working this is so hard I cant even get past the pool one howwwww Manage to get through it? We have a channel in our Discord server with hints, if you really hit a brick wall. Unfortunate that I found this when the reward expired, but it was fun figuring out the answers. I'm looking forward to the upcoming months! Although I will say, there is an answer in the October puzzle that is impossible to answer without the discord or having signed up to the monthly newsletter beforehand. Also, I was tearing out my hair trying to figure out the answer for the knife, but turns out my game was bugged and I wasn't able to view the most vital clue for the answer I like seeing puzzles like this. I don't like being forced to sign up for something Hello! In the backlog of new features we're looking at rolling out, we're thinking of a Guest Log in, which would bypass any formal sign in but then also forgo any reward (this is the only reason we have the sign in - to be able to deliver game keys and the partnered rewards we have.) Just as a heads-up for anybody else coming through here and reading this...in the intervening time since the parent comment was posted, this has happened; in the current versions of Puzzletrunk (both Web and desktop) there's a guest login option. Thanks for this, Arno - we should've posted an update to the comments, too. nice bro Loved it! Started off so hard and frustrating, I thought it was broke. But then I started to figure it out and realize some of the significant ways that it's different than before. So much fun! You did some impressive things with your app (in the name of puzzles) that I would've never even considered existing in an app. Very much looking forward to future months' puzzles on this platform. Oh, and the music selection was really really good - loved it! Head hurt, but puzzle good. Thanks Pantaloon. I don't usually vibe with ARG type puzzles, but the pantaloon newspaper puzzles have been enjoyable to solve so far, even for a smooth brained noob like me. Glad to see these in a nice collection now, and excited to try this month's puzzle!</TEXT>

What I noticed is that in the first few levels, the basic mechanics are taught. The rest of the levels make you put what you learned to use. I like this a lot! This is actually nice, the game logic and mechanics is perfect! It will be better if you can make some improvements on the graphics and try make the appearance of the key matching with its lock : I actually came back to play again! very good game! Love it! i think there's an issue with the button hitbox Sometimes, when you jump it doesn't register. By sometimes, I mean 60% of the time. Good! there s a bug on level 8 that respawns you in a wall you in a wall, forcing you to go out of the game and redo level 7 plz bug fix yeah it's really annoying but the game is very good</TEXT>

<TITLE>Puzzle Depot</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game A box-pushing, bug-squishing, post-apocalyptic adventure awaits you in Puzzle Depot! What starts as a simple matter of pushing boxes around a warehouse quickly escalates into a perilous adventure through a world of giant insects and rogue robots. Survive deadly roach-filled grottos, bubbling lakes of caustic goop, and the twisted industrial ruins of the eponymous Depot-13. Join survivors Stella, Todd, and other memorable characters in this comedic retro-futuristic brain-expanding quest through the most puzzling of Depots! Are you prepared for an exciting career in the field of cargo management? Puzzle Depot has released on Steam, but it will take just a couple more days for the itch.io version. Thank you for your understanding, and we will have this ready as soon as possible! Unzip contents to your preferred directory, then launch "PuzzleDepot.exe". Enjoy! View all posts Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Just finished this. Absolutely high-quality sokoban, loved the narrative, and a very robust level editor to boot (could use some tweaks, like a better way to navigate the items because scrolling's a chore--maybe not resetting the filters after a playtest is a good start? Also, being able to attach triggers to the cutscene entity would be VERY nice). Just waiting on that itch.io build now because I personally prefer that over Steam. Congratulations on finally releasing the game after a long time! Finally, your wonderful game is done—congrats! Will the Itch.io version come with a Steam key? If not, I totally understand and will just choose a platform. But Iâd gladly pay a few bucks more to have it on both. Same! I'm actually looking into this today. If I can do this while staying within Steam's ToS, I will make it happen! Demo has been updated to version 0.91! An official Kickstarter update will be up shortly explaining what is new. Here is the short version: Release is being delayed until Q2 of 2025 in order to include a widely-requested feature: an UNDO button! A functional Undo button is included in this current demo build (default is the 'Q' key). Like many other puzzle games, this function allows you to back up one move if you've made a mistake, so you don't have to restart the entire room. This is a massive improvement, and while there's still some tweaks and improvements to be made, it's already a literal game-changer! Tomorrow we are showing Puzzle Depot at the Seattle Indies Expo, a fantastic PAX-adjacent indie-focused event! We've put together a special showcase level just for the occasion, made of 80% recycled materials. Here's a sneak peek: Heads up, at long last the Steam page will be up within the next couple days! There will be a large official update at that point which I will also post here. There's quite a lot to talk about this time, including some upcoming events and conventions that Puzzle Depot will be part of! We're still shooting for Q4 2024 for release! First update of 2024, and it's a good one. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1781334061/puzzle-depot/posts/4026718 The short version is that we've updated the engine and overhauled just about every system for a lot of improvements. External testing is kicking off in the coming weeks and we are planning on wrapping up development this year. There are also previews of some of the completed levels that are worth a look if you like some fresh n' juicy gifs! (Also on my list is to give this page a fresh coat of paint!) EDIT : Kickstarter is chewing up those animated gifs pretty bad, here's an album for better viewing! https://imgur.com/a/2SQuEMJ Hey team, Any news on Puzzle Depot? Haven't heard from you all in a while! Thanks for checking in! I have another update in the works, I'm shooting to have that out before end of the month. I know it's been a long time coming. Currently we're wrapping up a new version of the game and completing the epilogue sequence for the campaign. I'll have more news soon with the next update! Any news on that? Sorry for the delay, there is an update coming out this weekend (likely Sunday). It's a big one! Hey Otto! How's Puzzle Depot doing these days? I hope you can finish it one day. It's one of my favourite pushpuzz games I've ever played, really got me to appreciate the genre by making it a bit more accessible, while still being really challenging. Hey, James! I actually just finished up a new version of Puzzle Depot, the latest build includes endgame and epilogue content. We're definitely closing in, I have some backer content to finish up but the list grows shorter! I know it's been a long while and I appreciate you checking in. I'd like to put together another Kickstarter update before much longer, I think we're about due for it. I'll be sure to update the itch.io page when that happens! Awesome! This game is great. The demo has a good length, the difficulty is perfect. Even the Graphic for this is nice. I enjoyed it andd recommend everybody to play this. I made a video about this games if someone is interested to watch it. Thank you so much for playing the demo! It's always fun to see someone's first reactions and thought process going through the puzzles. That's something we're really looking forward to when we release the full game. I am glad, that i can play this game. :) Excellent ! Will it get out of demo someday ? It definitely will be emerging from its demo status once it's done pupating! :] Testing has been going very well and we've made some pretty big steps recently. There's a new devlog up (mirrored from our latest KS update) with some fresh gifs to scope out in the meantime, while we continue pushing forward. Thanks for checking in with us! Just played the demo. Would love to see the rest of the game came for tinker knight stayed for cool gameplay So... This game is never coming out. Too bad, really could have been a nice one. ð¤·ââï¸ We're behind where we said we'd be, but, progress is still being made. I have a big update in this works, including things like getting this page up to date, our Steam page set up, etc. I'm sorry if I've let you down with delays, but I'm glad you're still interested in Puzzle Depot and I'll do my best to make it up to you. Thanks for reaching out! It made a great first impression, my comment from almost 4 years ago is still here. I won't say to hurry but the mechanics and controls were already really great (that's what really makes or brakes such games) and the story/content is something that always can look like needing "a little more" (polishing, details, etc) but that also means becoming stuck in limbo. In any case, thanks for your reply, it's good to see it! I simply loved this game, can't wait to the date release!!! hope to see this game finished in 2018. Hey keser-one, sorry it's been a while! I actually just made a quick KS update to check in: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1781334061/puzzle-depot/posts/2085854 Thanks for keeping an eye on Puzzle Depot, I know it's been a long wait. I'm confident that it will be worth it! omg i am so proud and happy for you! you must be exhausted after this loooong road lmao. ok i can still hold out a little bit more for it. still my day one. Kickstarter Update #46: Progress Report https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1781334061/pu... Things are really coming along! This update features our new Options menu, controller support, and improvements to the World Editor! I went back and played through the entire demo again: I still love this game so much, as i state in the video congrats are the successful funding for it ^_^ Kickstarter Update #45 is up! Sorry that I missed a couple updates! This is a good one, though... We are pleased to announce that Shovel Knight's own master schemer, Tinker Knight, will be appearing in Puzzle Depot as a playable character, courtesy of Yacht Club Games! We're really excited for this opportunity! And if you haven't checked out Shovel Knight yet... you really should :] Kickstarter Update #42 is up! The Circuit Update This one is all about the changes that "circuit objects" have undergone, such as buttons, plates, and doors. Things are far more versatile than they used to be! Great graphics! Looking forward to the complete game! Esta bueno, con una historia y atmÃ³sfera interesante dentro de una mecÃ¡nica de puzzles clÃ¡sica. Aunque muy corto a mi parecer. Just wanted to say thank you everyone who has played and commented, we appreciate your support! Also, there is a new update on our Kickstarter page, in which I go into detail about the puzzle design process. If you're into that kind of thing, check it out! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1781334061/puzzle-depot/posts/1531663 I absolutely love it. Simple concept but awesome atmosphere and variatons. The demo was great! Surprisingly addictive and with a great art style. Can't wait to buy the full product! How can that simple box-pushing job escalates to something serious this quickly?! Oh I love this game! I love the look of it. Reminds me a little of CLARC, Parcel, Full Bore and Toki Tori 2+. I hope you're planning on releasing it for Linux eventually. It looks and plays great. Looking forward for realese. Btw. it doesn't work with itch.io app.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ludum Dare 40 Compo entry. Theme "The more you have, the worse it is". Made a puzzle game where the objective is to get the gold block to land on to the green trigger in the least amount of turns possible, each phase (puzzle) introduces a new block mechanic and also increases the number of gold blocks in the puzzle. It is a very early prototype of the game of course. set it up as more of a demo to try out the games features and we will be considering continuing this further as a potential mobile game idea. Ludum Dare entry's made by @essejparr. Edit 1* There is a known bug with the gold blocks respawning after they have already fallen, since there is no trigger event related with the green buttons, if you land a gold block on the green just count that gold block as complete and disregard the respawn. https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/puzzle-progress-prototype Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Puzzle Of Life</TITLE>
<TEXT>Puzzle Of Life is a mind-bending logical game about evolution where you help primordial organisms to emerge. Developed during the Castle Game Jam 2018 . The game starts with a single RNA based organism/bacteria similar to Cyanobacteria already present in the environment. By applying green or blue chemical effects you start building two different DNA strands (animals: blue, plats: green). During the following two levels you can create a more complex animal or plant specimens by applying a mixture of blue and green DNA enhancing effects (! Only one effect application per level is allowed ). The goal of the game is to advance as many animal or plant organisms to earn the highest score. You can advance a blue animal organism by applying blue DNA effect to keep its genetic material pure. You can advance blue animal organism by applying green DNA effect to make it a ânewâ blue-green and more complex organism. But you kill ânewâ blue-green animal organism by applying old blue DNA effect, therefore, stunting its development process. You can advance a green plant organism by applying green DNA effect to keep its genetic material pure. You can advance green plant organism by applying blue DNA effect to make it a ânewâ green-blue and more complex organism. But you kill ânewâ green-blue plant organism by applying old green DNA effect, therefore, stunting its development process.

<TITLE>Puzzle Picker</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and Android In order to make a quick buck, you decide to make simple puzzle games. But you don't want to hire any designers, so you get a monkey to make the puzzles. Quickly determine whether the puzzles created by the monkey are 'solvable' or 'unsolvable', by swiping them right or left. There are three stages with slider puzzles to rack up as many points as you can. This is a mouse only game. This has been submitted to the 2018 GMTK Game Jam, genre without mechanic. This game is a puzzle game where you can't actually perform any moves to solve the puzzle. Post-jam update, Version 1.1 is out, here are some of the changes: A fourth and final level is added. Scores are tweaked, can you get a 1000 points? Score screen now shows puzzle you timed out on. Two extra colour options added. Every puzzle in later stages will have gimmick (used or not). Minimization bug fixed, and screen resizing allowed. The first is a windows stand-alone executable. The second is an Android apk file, which will need to be installed using an apk installer. The third is the windows executable of the original GMTK 2018 jam submission. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Super clever idea! Was fun and frantic.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Puzzle Juggle Trouble</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Ever thought Tetris was too easy, or not "puzzle" enough? That there were not enough pieces? Or that you should be rewarded for stacking cleanly even if you don't make full lines? Try out Spyro Oshisaure's Puzzle Juggle Trouble then! In this game, just like in regular Tetris, pieces fall from the sky. Unlike regular Tetris however, you are given multiple pieces at once, and you can swap between controlling one or another at any given time. You clear blocks by either making solid lines, or by filling square regions of at least 5 blocks by 5 blocks. The former increases the speed of the blocks' fall, the latter makes you move on to more and more complex pieces. Try Arcade mode to see how far you go and push for higher scores, or race in Time Trial to set record times! You can also play Arcade mode in local Co-op between a keyboard player and a controller player, or have a custom game of Arcade mode where you can change various settings, from what pieces you get to how many at once are falling or even the size of the board.

Except for the first extra level, all extra levels were added post-jam. All changes are detailed in the patchnotes down below. Coin Puzzles is a puzzle platformer made for Ludum Dare 44. The theme for this Ludum Dare was "Your life is currency". In the game you control a bag of coins. The amount of coins in the bag influences your movement and interaction with other objects. There are a total of 15 levels. The in game options are a bit limited, but there is a sound slider and a toggle to turn on/off the music. There is also a slider for Awesomeness which might completely change the game into FPS, but it could also do absolutely nothing at all. Total development time: 22 hours + 17 hours [post-jam] Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. the idea is nice and well realized but there isnt enough feedback for loosing coins specialy since i had to mute the tab this game was running on and burn my speakers just so i dont get ear cancer from this atrocious music . anyway its inpressive that you managed to make a game at all in that small of a time frame and with the limitations of ludumdare .

<TEXT>A downloadable game You are the only and great Robin Hood! You live in your camp. You get raided by Roman Empire. You must defend yer land. But behold! You have only one arrow! And you need nothing more, your shoot-then-retrieve-it journey begins! Trailers: Game made for the global game jam 2021 by: Modestas Daugvydas Mantas Eduard Inga Giedrius Eugenijus Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. yo get this game to 1 million plays guys nice game concept. i hope there are ways to wield other weapons like sword as option to fight the enemies. the game kind a lags a bit but seems fun anyway. cant wait for full game great game, a little choppy and buggy but would love to see this in the future. Starts at 5:49. Was a great little game and a really fun concept! It definitely needs work in a lot of aspects, but at the core, it is really fun to play and has great visuals! The game was super vibrant and really felt fresh and really had a breath taking environment! Even the subtle and soft background noises enhanced the whole game's feel. (Video below is anyone wants to watch!) That being said, I felt like the core mechanic of the game could be improved. One way is by adding more arrows around the map as it's really easy to shoot one off into the distance and not able to get it back or lose it. Another suggestion is to make the aiming mechanic better, while the current way is pretty funny and adds to the game, it can be very frustrating as the player could be in the face of an enemy by completely miss due to RNG. So I think having the RNG reticle system should be used when hip firing/ not aiming and then either making the reticle smaller or just having a precise arrow where the player is aiming might be a good thing as it promotes skill and also makes the player feel less frustrated and more in control of their character and the way they shoot! Other than that, I think the game looks and feel great and is super fun to play! The glowing arrows were a great choice and that's more apparent in night time; when the arrow can be followed by it's glow. Side note; the lakes looked great with the glowy arrows in them at night! But yeah, the above were just suggestions; it's a great game so far and so good luck on future updates if you decide to work on this game some more! it's lagging in my laptop hmm, I've checked and it lags on my laptop too. We developed it on pretty beefy pcs. Not sure if we'll get back to this game to optimize it tho cool game Thank you for the video! The main time that the game lags is on startup and that's a unity thing, the only way to fix that is to add a loading screen and we should also add graphics settings, if we decide to make a full version is this for mac or windows hello, it was made and tested for windows Thank you for playing our game! It was super entertaining to watch :D But it's not even a demo, we made it during a game jam and it only took 2 days of work. So I don't think we'll be making a full version</TEXT>

NIKOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aww I wanted Prototype to finish his explanation on why sugar gets sticky. Awesome game, loved to see Niko again. wow now i remember when someone made a whole discord just for waiting for this game peak stuff :D goooooooooo this game makes me hungry Amei o jogo e as receitas me deram Ã¡gua na boca ð I have returned my loyal followers I am Mold Mario, and I approve this message YAY any chance that it'll be ported to linux? it doesnt seem to work for me using wine, had to use another computer to play it... Run it through Steam using Proton 7.0-6 What's Niko favourite colos? The conversation about measuring cups at the start really is funny to me, and I especially loved how Prototype jumped right into explaining everything. I found it amusing in this scene. When the characters shared their breakfast recipes, it added even more charm to the story. Learning about their food choices was fun, even though the idea of putting coffee in almost everything felt a bit strange to me. Playing this game even made me hungry, and I got to learn the recipe. I might try making it myself because the whole experience felt so cozy and enjoyable from start to finish. Damn, what a nice little game :) scrumptiosu Wholesome, cute AND delicious! i finally got to making them after two weeks and they are so good i agree I REQUIRE TO MAKE THOSE PANCAKES i love stupid human cat make stupid blurred pancake with giant spoiler on it :3 99% talk 1% pancakes So cute! I gotta try to make those pancakes someday! Thank you guys, this was really lovely Will this ever be added as DLC? How much does it cost to upload DLC to Steam? i will just post this from steam forum Source: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/dlc Referenced "Depot Documentation": https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots So @Topic: No it does not cost you extra $100 to release a DLC. You simply update the file-pool of your base game and create a new depot for a DLC that should be buyable. Then you link your desired DLC files with said depot and there you go It is soooooooo cool, how i didn't know about that game, i just wanna do them so much, that i want to eat and now is 0:30, best game i ever played 10 pancakes / 10, so much smiling and i won't regret my decision to not go to sleep HOW HAS IT BEEN 10 YEARS ALREADY?! time flies when oneshot I will be playing this later. Thank you, Future Cat Games & Nightmargin. I know a bit of Japanese, but not a lot, but maybe I could make a Translation patch? masterpeice 10 years?!!, how passing the timeâ¦ Iâm remember when Iâas played this game in 2014 I made Polish translations for OneShot and OneShot the Pancake Episode! Happy 10th Anniversary! Where are they? My game does not start, a window just appears for a second and then disappears. I had the same error with the main game, but there I simply changed it to the 32-bit version. Exactly as advertised, nobody died and Niko got pancakes pot***ium Cesium better. Happy birthday! sorry niko im kinda late, but happy birthday Happy Late Ass 10th Anniversary! (I Said Late Ass Because I'm Late By 34 Days.) cool, tho idk where i could find a spanish localization,,</TEXT>

I sat on one of the pages so long because I wasn't sure what was going on until I realized there was a continuing arrow lol woah! got curious after i saw this in the last indiepocalypse because the premise sounded a lot like a game i'm currently working on myself, and i'm glad i clicked! really cool glitchy effects, and i love the look of the interface Brilliant work!! The first set of questions are common, but the second set of questions get more personal. It really you feel like you are being being dragged into a bad place. I was genuinely afraid of a realistic image jumpscare the entire time. (thanks for not including it :P). The part where it says that you should take a break before/after proceeding is a nice trick to creates a lot of suspense. Well done. Haha, thank you so much for playing and no, I would never do jumpscares, I find them somewhat cheap when you have so many more ways to build up tension and creepyness! Iâm really glad you enjoyed it! <3</TEXT>

Trenches is a psychological horror game - where your only escape is through your senses and hearing using your trench whistle to guide you, however that also comes at a price since the enemy can hear your trench whistle. Enemies will also be able to hear if you walk on wood as it will make creaking noise or if you break any bottles.

Be careful when walking on wooden surface since it makes loud noise. 5. You can cause a distraction by throwing objects items such as bottles. 6. Mind your stamina, if you get tired then you cannot outrun your enemies. 7. Use your trench whistle if you're lost and follow the sound, but be careful because enemies can hear the whistle too and come running to your location. 8. Be careful of your surroundings. Some things are real, while others are not. 9. If you hear running footsteps, that's not good news - as they may have heard you. Run or hide!

<TITLE>Eyes Blind Open (Psychological Horror Game) (2018)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows and macOS (Read below for more information on the game, lore, music, endings, etc...) This game was designed to be completely playable by those who are visually impaired. All menus can be navigated by simply hitting space. The primary objective of the game is to traverse a maze of ropes without making too much noise. Players will be guided by sound cues such as pings, which mean that you are currently traveling on the correct path. When you hear a can rattling noise, it means you have walked into a noose. If you hit a noose too many times, something will begin to chase you. The character is controlled by the W A S D keys on a 90-degree pivot. Each direction has a unique sound associated with it. When an item is acquired, the Left Click of the mouse may be pressed to use the item. There are other power-ups, and many secrets left to be discovered, including 3 unique endings. Every ending has its own trophy displayed on the main menu when completed. In order to earn each ending, specific steps have to be taken beyond completing the maze. Items such as an ax can be acquired through locating its procedurally generated position on the map. Every song and sprite was created by me, with the exception of sections of one song. (The song that plays when you beat one of the endings. RickLan is credited in the credits on completion of the game.)

When i start to play the game it stops playing and says something about a index buffer and i can't play it. While I find the game interesting, I would recommend periodically allowing the player to see where they are so they can make use of both coordinates and seeing where they are. Beyond that, I like the art style. Having an issue playing this on my Mac I keep getting a thing saying the game is damaged and can't be opened ? hi ! not official itch support, but i had a similar problem with a game the other day and itch support said that the best workaround is to use the itch app (linked here ). hope this helps!</TEXT>

Another gameplay from Z9GN <3 A playthrough from 1Clef2Pieces of my game along another visual novelð aun no lo he jugado pero me gustaria , pero esta en espaÃ±ol? Hola, gracias por interesarte en nuestro juego<3 AÃºn no hemos lanzado versiÃ³n en espaÃ±ol pero debido al apoyo que ha recibido podrÃ­amos lanzarla en poco tiempo ^^ We're glad you liked the art and the story since all our effort was put into this game. Thank you for playing our visual novel<3 So sorry for my late reply! I'm glad you liked the visual novel. We really appreciate that you enjoyed the story and even cried with it, we did our best to make this game. Thank you! â¥â¥â¥â¥ I can't even press play, mine just wont work. Really annoyed expected more. I am very sorry that you had this bad experience. However, the game has been tested in different machines and by a lot of people so it's not a general issue. Could you please describe your problem in deep? And just in case, what are the specifications of your device? When I entered the game I tried to press all the options but all of them would not work and I just stayed on screen where the play, load, and save was. also tried to exit it and play again but to my disappointment it still didn't work, I just kept pressing play over and over without it doing anything. I'm using windows Also I'm sorry if I sounded rude earlier I typed that complaint like at 2 am The title screen works with the arrow keys and Enter button, maybe you tried to use your mouse and that's why it didn't work? And don't worry, I understand how frustrating it can be ^^ I really like the story of this game and the art is really beautiful and has such a great dark and eery video to it. I'm still a bit lost on what exactly the story is portraying. I would love it if anyone could comment on what interpret the story as. I'm very grateful for your playthrough! The game tries to convey the fine line between what we consider fantasy and reality. It has two endings with entirely different meanings which can be interpreted as the player decides â¥â¥â¥â¥ Oh ok, thank you so much for responding. I am not crying I just have something in my eye...This game really is a tear-jerker of emotions. I had no idea what I was going to play I thought possibly that it was even going to be a horror game from the almost ink blot like starting page, but it was a surprise how touching and sweet this game was. I felt so many emotions and yet the strongest I felt was love. It would have been nice to get to know Silvia a bit more and the background story behind her but it was nevertheless a short and sweet visual novel. I hope you create more games. Thank you so much for the playthrough! The game is short since we didn't have enough time to develop a longer story as it was going to be submitted for a jam. And I really appreaciate the comments from people saying they like my games, you have my eternal gratitude â¥â¥â¥ REALLY GREAT VN GAME, VERY LIKED IT, THANKS DEV Thanks to you for playing our games! â¤â¤â¤ Thank you for sending me this visual novel. I would've missed it otherwise. 10/10 I'm glad you liked it. Thank you very much! â¤â¤â¤ You're welcome :) Really enjoyed playing through In the Shade of Lilies! ^o^ Thank you so much! I loved the playthroughâ¥</TEXT>

<TITLE>Silence Audio Pack â Sounds of Eerie Psychological Horror$9.99</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack A loopable ambient audio collection steeped in oppressive stillness, uneasy air, and the intangible weight of unseen presences. This pack captures the unnerving textures of sound that seep into the mind when nothing should be heard—yet something is.

Perfect for psychological horror, eerie explorations, and liminal environments where the mind fills the quiet with imagined terrors. These recordings donât simply portray absence—they embody a presence that should not be there. â½ï¸ Preview: *Please note: A beep is inserted every 5 seconds in this demo version for protection purposes.

<TITLE>Trisolation MindGrind: A Playfully Uncited Interactive Psychological Model</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable Seal for Windows This game was made for the Safe In Our World Mental Health Game Dev Champions 2024 . This is the first video game I've ever made! Its a short arcade-style game. Some extra info if you get confused: -As the orange bar diminishes, the blue bar is in more danger. -If the blue bar goes out, the yellow bar depletes immensely. -If the yellow bar goes out, its game over. I originally had no idea what to do for this project honestly, I just saw that gamedevs were joining game jams to get into the industry so I wanted to start building experience right away. The idea actually came to me in another video game, where it described mental illness (or just depression, i can't remember) as bad people you put up with in your mind-house. I'm not describing it well, but it was the inspiration for this game. I won't say any more, because I'd like it if you interpreted the work yourself. Have fun, and remember... Mind the Walls!

Hello EdLioni. Great scary game! 5 Stars!! great game. will there be a chapter 2? Chapter 1 pretty much wrapped up the story. game was released in 2020 so i doubt there will be i thought as much, but couldn't hurt to try. This games story telling/story fucking sucks - im sorry but my honest opinion I really enjoyed playing Chapter 1 and im a little bummed that its been a while and still no chapter 2. The scares were perfect . I look forward to playing chapter 2 whenever it comes out :) What an awesome example of horror game pacing! Not only were the scares super well distributed with some jump and some just thought-provoking, but the environment building and use of audio was top-notch! The only minor suggestion I would have is to add a few more interactions in the various environments to add a bit more world-building. Not necessary, but could be more engaging! Would absolutely love to see a Chapter 2! I can tell this game was made with love, there was a lot of attention to detail here. The ghost was creepy, the house had a decent layout and the plot was straightforward. Very creepy in certain areas, it felt unsettling too! My playthrough of your game loved the game. thankyou!! I claimed it from the givaway but It is not working and I cant download it and it looks like a REALLY good game so That is a BIG shame.. Epic! Can't wait for Chapter 2 :)) i absolutely want more. tried to download and wont allow it. it looked really good so thats a shame. nvm i got it on steam. The dev didn't set up the game to work with the itch client. same :( Are you thinking of doing part 2? I saw it 2 years ago, part 2 hasn't appeared yet This gmae sis acctally realy scary https://youtu.be/LlIy7P0wZ7E really liked it played this on my youtube channel loved the game i was spooked and it did really good for people seeing the game so thank you for making this game GHOST OF TOMORROW (DEMO) - YouTube EdLioni, I thought the idea and concept of your game was really cool, I wanted to ask you two questions, the first question is if the game will soon be on Mobile Platforms, I heard that there are few horror games there, so I wanted to know about it, the other question will the game have more languages? Comments below clip; Sometimes it's best not to know. This is one of those cases. Don't believe me? Play the game! Awesome graphics and atmosphere! Love it! If you like horror games, please subscribe and help my channel grow, thanx! Not a bad little game, good work :) Okay. Probably the most disturbing game I have played this year so far! The story was so gripping and thought it was clever, especially at the end, "I was at your funeral." Like oof, what's happening here? Here is my gameplay of chapter 1. Please check it out! I cannot wait for more chapters. Since I deleted the original video, I made on this in 2019 when the demo came out, I decided to pay it a revisit. Tbh it still holds up might pick up Chapter 1 sometime in the near future. I believe I had recorded the early access though as I remember being able to walk in that blue hallway. But I don't have that itch account anymore, but the demo isn't bad. Great game!!!! I recommend everyone to play this game!!! Can't wait for other chapters! Very cool and terrifying. Hope to see more chapters of this game. Awesome demo! Will more than likely play the full game! Your game is the 2nd one in this video <3 K I have only had the chance to play the demo so far, but I really enjoyed it. The pacing and atmosphere are good and I'm interested to find out more about the story. I am looking forward to playing the full game in the near future. Very good (start). The developer has a keen eye and a great sense of pacing, art direction, and storytelling. The first chapter really felt like a teaser and didn't give the whole breadth of the programming potential, which leave with the question - how dynamic will the game world and storyline be in the final release? Maybe the question are intentially generated... well done! </TEXT>

Hello Jen! I'm at chapter 4 atm, still not done with the game yet but since I'm a little bit confused I thought I could leave a comment so you could reexplain what I'm misunderstanding (spoilers ahead) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - In this chapter we finally learn Ilyon's real name (Caylis) but when we explore the Gamma constellation, Ritcher aludes to him feeling guilty for being unable to save Serci and Caylis back then, but isnt Caylis Krey's biological child? The one who was stillborn? Or was he talking about a different person completely? - Who's Riesha? A servant or a nanny I'm assuming? Since Krey's wife died from childbirth? (Unless I'm misremembering??) I probably sound like a broken record at this point but I'm really enjoying this game despite being unable to play as often as I'd like. Also, Gulli and Ritcher's friendship is really wholesome, it's a shame it couldnt last due to circumstances they had no control over... Hi Nootellix, Thank you for your question! I'm glad you are so interested in the side characters and all the confusing twists of Ilyon's scattered memories. Spoilers Krey(elf) is actually Serci's(elf) brother. He's Ilyon's uncle who took him in after Serci and Ilyon's human father Cayden were killed by the Council, for their forbidden union. Krey's own wife and child died in childbirth, so Krey and Serci tried to save Ilyon by pretending he was Krey's child. This is why Krey bitter/neglectful towards Ilyon. To him, his unnatural existence of being a half elf, half human cost him everyone and was no replacement for his deceased wife and son. In one of the alternate reality, Caylis's cousin is still alive and he looks similair to Ilyon but with purple hair like Serci and Krey. Sorry it's been a long time since I looked at this story! Aww see? That's what happens when I play on and off, I inevitably get things mixed up. ð© Thanks for clearing that up and have a nice day! Hey, for a game with two unfinished routes, I think it's pretty polished. Don't sell yourself short. Take care. :) Hi Nootellix, Thanks for your understanding and well wishes! You, too. Take care! No problem, you deserve all the praise. I havent played much, only reached the part where we meet our guide yesterday. The story is well written and I love the "old anime"-esque aesthetic. Also, I appreciate you for giving us the option to be understanding/empathetic despite Ilyon's cynical nature, many people conflate being cynical and being mean unfortunately which limits my options in VNs sometimes. Have a lovely week-end Jen, I can't wait to play your other games. They've been on my To Be Played list for quite some time. Is the game complete with all routes or was it abandoned with only two complete routes? Hi Drelopi, This was my first game so although I would've liked to go back and finish the two characters that didn't get finished (I had sprites and chapter 1 completed so it definitely felt bad not finishing them) I think I was too ambitious with how incredibly messy and inefficient my code/writing structure was. The two companions available have 6 endings each, so the 'two routes' still have 12 endings took me a lot time to complete. I'm sorry I never finished the others. To be transparent, I make free games as a fun hobby, so I don't see myself at this point having fun returning to this. I apologize for my mistake. It's ok, thanks for clarifying. You made a very interesting game with cool characters, it makes me want to see other routes too. And thanks for answering my question. Is the game still in-development or is finished/completed? Hi There, The Thief and Bard Routes are completely finished. I've moved on to other projects atm, but I hope to someday and revisit this project in the future. Thanks for checking it out! Thank you for elaborating. Thank you for the wonderful game, I've been enjoyed it so far but I decide not to give a review before having finished it. By the way, the is a problem for me. In this scene, the list just go on and I'm sure that there are choices that are hidden below the text frame and maybe the window can't even contain it, is there any way to fix this? I will appreciate it if you can help me and sorry for my bad English https://imgur.com/cbXgQTz Hi Liberia! Ah yes, I apologize that there are a few times in the game that its possible to collect too many items to display at once. When you use the items, they should drop from your inventory and you should be able to see the overflow ones take their spot. I think it has something to do with Renpy's built in menu option select. I'll consider working on this problem and see if I can come up with a solution. Thank you for pointing this out and for trying out my game. Also items do not stay with the player when you move to the next chapter (as their only purpose is for that chapter's puzzle), so there's no benefit to holding on to them. Best wishes~ One of my favourite games. The writing is pleasantly ornate and poetic, the music being a nice complement. The art has this surreal feeling, especially with the movement of the sprites. The faint blush is something I love also, giving a more meaningful feeling just because it isn't 'jumping' in your face. I like the story a lot, and would love to see more of Ilyon's childhood, as well as more of the others' backstories. And can I just say I ADORE Mikail and his dynamic with Ilyon, they just go so well together (not only romantically). Edit: I forgot to say how much I love Ritcher's character designð­ð­ð­(and also everything else about himð). Oh and something I've noticed is that the skip button doesn't work on all scenes, is that something intentional? Alsooo-I'm very curious about the heights of our mains (Ilyon, Keska, Mikail, Grei and Simion). Can I find this information anywhere? Well, i think that is all, i wish you have a good time working on your projects and i hope many more people discover your games and art. <3 Hi Ancaa, Thank you so much for playing my game and sharing some of your thoughts with me. Ritcher was a character that I never got a chance to explore in the original comic and I'm glad you liked his design. If you haven't seen my video I made working on sprite, you can get a better view of it. Sadly I had to export the animation at a lower framerate for the game, so I think some of the detail was lost. As far as heights of the characters go, I don't tend to write detailed character profiles like this anymore (such as height, birthdays ect) but somewhere out there there might be something I wrote back when I was working on the comics when height reference was more important. I seem to remember Ilyon as being 5'10", Mikail 5'8", Keska 5'6", Grei 5'2" and Simion 6'2". Or something close to that XD;; it was a 20 years ago. Dang. 20 years...! Anyways thanks again so much and best wishes~ You made my day! I actually saw a few of your yt videos yesterday, including the Ritcher one (of course i couldn't skip him), and also some of the 2021 designs. I finished all the endings and most of the dialogue options last night, but I totally forgot about the comic. I need to read it rigt away. Thank you for the answer on their heights, it helps me picture them a lot better. <3 Oh wow! That's super awesome that you saw all the endings ;_; I appreciate you so much. I forgot to answer your other question about the skip function. I believe the only thing that I tried to disable skip on was the movie cutscenes because it was super easy to skip them by accidently clicking. I wonder if you don't mind me asking, what you thought of the different epilogues? I tried to make them different and equally fleshed out but I admit I was starting to get burnt out so I don't know how successful I was. Thanks again~ I don't mind at all, on the contrary, I really enjoy sharing my thoughts. I love how the style changes when you wake up, becoming more 'realistic', really emphasizing the fact that you're no longer dreaming. The different endings were really enjoyable, giving us different scenarios and letting us see more of the characters, which I truly appreciate, I can tell it was a lot of work (please remember not to overwork yourself). My favourites were Mikail's empathy endigs-I loved seeing more of his playful and domestic side; but also Keska's logic endings-I feel like I could relate to her reaction, not knowing if anything was real, if Ilyon would come for her, and bluntly telling him what was on her heart (besides, her dress was gorgeous). Hi again Ancaa, I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. I also think that the empathy trait compliments Mikail very well, as it helps him feel needed and eases his insecurity issues. Also I think logical Ilyon helps Keska grow as well, she's a bit more cautious and less dependent when Ilyon is more pragmatic, but I think that helps her become more self-sufficient. this game looks so beautifully done omg i can't wait to play it : Thank you for taking a look at my work. I hope you do get a chance to play it and let me know what you think <3 Best wishes Really want to play this so bad, have been lurking it for months and months, but I want to wait until it's finished >.< I never play games unless they're finished to save myself the heartache and yearning LOL. I hope one day you come back to making it and finish it. Hello allow me to welcome you to the life of completion only consumption. I will now bestow apon you the life line tool of vn searching. https://vndb.org/v You will soon find out that the life you have choosen is destined for hours of scrolling looking for completed works, free and paid. Good luck on your adventure commrade. But seriously if you need any recomendations I can save you some time and give you some if you want lol. Yep yep I already know about VNDB, I've been playing otomes since I was around the age of 9 and I'm going on 25 this year ðð Played hundreds at this point that I'm a veteran and an old seasoned hag, even. ð Can even do some programming myself. Thank you for the thought though haha that's very kind of you. Yeah I just like to periodically check up on some games I was interested in and show support to the devs. OOOOOF You are in worse shape than me lol! LMFAO FACTS I have completely surrendered myself to this life of visual novels ð You too shall get shackled in to this life. ð I've played Mikail (Romantic)-Logic and Keska (Romantic)-Empathy, and I gotta say, I really did enjoy this game. I'm currently playing through Mikail-Power as well, and it's made me appreciate how much your choice of stat changes the game. I also enjoyed the overall, uh, dream-like atmosphere (lol) , and your take on cynicism and overcoming it was something that appealed to me. Also, I really enjoyed the dynamics between the main character and his vassals, and I fuckign love Mikail and Keska. (Spoilers below) If I had to point out some flaws though, I'd say that chapter 2 can feel a bit repetitive. I get the feeling that that was the point but having to frequently backtrack and then run back again got annoying quite quickly. I prefer the castle and the puzzles it had as it was less tedious. Nothign else comes to mind though, sorry. Hi sageleaf, I agree with your critique of chapter 2 and it's feeling of redundancy. I think in my original plans, I didn't expect players to visit all the rooms, (since only one key item and 3 items total are only necessary to light the hearths) but in actuality most players will want to make sure they aren't missing anything. I'm glad you still stuck through it and enjoyed the characters. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts with me :). Spoiler ahead Yes. You must part ways with your vassal at the catacomb door to complete chapter 3. At least temporarily. It's possible to reunite on the other side if you have confirmed either a friendship or romance (a special scene in the their room on the top floor of the castle should give you the option if your trust and/or attract is +30 and you have watched the previous 10point milestones) scenes continue to unlock up to 50 after confirming friendship or romance but are not required to complete the game to the good endings/epilogue. Hope that helps! okay. omg i was thinking way too hard into it! thank you!!! So when I first saw this banner I read Soul Onion and psychological fantasy and I was like, oh that sounds intriguing! I'm almost disappointed I got it wrong, but I'm curious enough to play now anyway. <3 Oh Soul Onion does sound like a very interesting title lol. The font I chose definitely could have been cleaner. Thanks for checking it out anyway ð How do I open this on linux? I apologize in advance, as I don't use Linux so I'm not sure if this works but doing a google search I found this. https://appuals.com/how-to-play-renpy-visual-novels-on-a-linux-machine/ Hope it's helpful! tysm! Hello, the game is absolutely wonderful! The art has this unique, dreamy quality, and the writing absolutely tugs at your heartstrings. Both released thus far are incredible. However, I would like to report a bug in Keska's route. In the thid time you visit her room, when she offers you a massage, clicking in the option "In that case, I'm looking forward to it" shows a Mikail scene. Anyway, this has been an amazing read! Hi Isawrites, Thank you so much for trying out my game. I'm sorry that you encounter that bug! Thank you for reporting it. I'm really happy to read that you enjoyed your time with the story and characters so far. I have a lot of plans for this project in the future~ I played your game: Oh gosh, thank you so much for taking the time to try out my game. Your review was very generous! Best wishes~ Hello Again! Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts. I love reading them. Please let me respond to your feedback point by point. There may be spoilers in some of my answers~ 1. I'm glad that you were able to enjoy the game as an experience despite it's many flaws in execution. I plan on leaving this version up even after I remake it, as I think it has it's own "charm" that may be lost in my attempt to refine it. I'm planning some pretty big narrative changes for the remake, so I think it will be interesting for someone like yourself to compare. There was a power imbalance that I am uncomfortable with, and I want to give the vassals more agency. I'm planning more character and relationship development outside of the ritual, before the epilogue so I hope that will help the reader to explore another side to the characters. To make room for this new expansion, relationship paths will be narrowed to two opposed to six. 2. I'm glad that you enjoyed Keska's character. As a creator and I mother, I feel like my characters are kind of like my children, so I can't favor one over the others. As far as the endings go, all of the empathy, power and logic routes share similar resolutions when it comes to Noctisse. In his empathy routes, Ilyon's companions attempt to "rescue" him from his complicated relationship with Noctisse. I suppose Ilyon made himself appear vulnerable enough to them that they felt inspired to "help" him. They probably also felt supported enough to act on their own personal grievances against Noctisse as well, considering she threatened them into the whole ritual thing to begin with. In his power routes, he takes more upon himself to challenge Noctisse directly and his logic routes, he cautiously tolerates Noctisse, deciding ultimately to bide his time. In all versions of the endings, Mikail does not like Noctisse and sees her as a threat to both himself and his cherished person. He's not the type of person to consider nuance. I'm sure he would personally rather she disappear forever regardless of Ilyon's chosen approach. I'm pleased you were able to pick up on that XD. 3. Thank you for pointing out the bug! I think there's a couple of those in Keska's path, since I made her path after Mikail's. I reused some of the scripts for an "outline" to follow and I must have accidentally left one of jumps to the wrong script. Sorry about that! Most of my friends are team Mikail, so I feel her path was not as well tested, lol. 4. The hearths in the tunnels are representative of destruction, reverence and preservation. The objects collected and used as fuel are representative of memories. Ilyon can only "destroy" the memories if his power is at a certain level. He can "revere" the memories if his empathy is high enough, and he can "preserve" them if his logic is at a certain level. Fueling the flame grants Ilyon a large bonus to that corresponding trait. I don't believe it's possible to have all three stats high enough at the same run through to use all three options, so at that point of the game, the player must commit to one trait of their two highest traits above the others. 5. My friend Kerry has composed all the music specifically for this game. She's played it extensively as I've been creating it, so she's very familiar with the story, themes and characters. We've also been friends for decades so she has a pretty good idea of how my brain works and my general sensibilities, lol. I feel like she always manages to nail the feeling I'm going for, even though I give her little to no direction. I'm really lucky to have her as a friend and composer! Thank you again for this discussion, I enjoyed it ^^ Finished my first playthrough (Mikail, romantic, Empathy + I talked to him to the very end and did exactly what he suggested). Loved it, loved everything about it. The passion and all the thought that went into this, the aesthetics, the fact that the puzzles were easy enough even for me ;-), the fact that everytime I thought "oh, I've got this, I know what this game wants from me" I was soon proven wrong and I had to think about my answers and action. I was invested in the characters (in Mikail the most, of course), and I feel that I wouldn't be able to simply recreate the story that I have just experienced, which makes it unique. It also makes me look forward to the next unique story as I try again. I wonder what happens if I try to ascend through logic with Keska as a friend by my side. I'm not good with elegant complements (which is maybe why I could easily identify with Ilyon ;-) ), but I just wanted to say that you should be really proud of this game. Hi there, I'm so glad that you enjoyed your first play through. I spent a lot of time brewing over the characters and themes explored and I really hoped to create an overall introspective experience. I'm planning to go back and refine and focus my themes for clarity and impact. I hope you enjoy your next delve with Keska, and continue to watch this project grow in the future. Thank you again so much for trying out my game and taking the time to share your thoughts. It means a lot to me. Ahhh I just finished my first playthrough (I went for a Mikhail+Romance+Logic route), and I think the best way to describe how I feel about Soul Union is just totally enamoured!! I really really love how you get to explore the map and poke around everywhere for clues, and it's awesome how the music and the art and the animation all come together to make a really immersive, beautiful, and mysterious experience. The characters are honestly the greatest too, and it's super fun to see their personalities shine through with their dialogue as they banter and interact with each other! I can't wait to try out Keska's route and eventually check out all the endings! :DDD Also, I was wondering if it would be alright if I made fanart of Soul Union? I'll be sure to credit you if I post it, but it's totally cool if you say no too! I'm so glad that you enjoyed what you've played so far and I hope you also enjoy Keska's route. I definitely want to revisit and develop this story and characters some more in the future. I would absolutely looove to see a fanart if you're so inclined! Thank you so much!! Thank you so much for trying out the game. I'm so glad that you enjoyed it. I hope you will continue to follow these games as I continue to expand on this world. I love this game so much. I don't even know how to begin, lol. The art is amazing, and I love the little animations and the characters ( especially their design ). The story is very captivating, well-written and interesting. The music is so cool and good to listen to! It is an amazing work. To be honest, at first I wasn't really keen of the game. But after I gave it a try... I am totally hooked on it. This is an art piece, truly. <3 SPOILERS BELOW - i just wanted to know; can you give a hint to how finish chapter 3 w/ Mikail? I am revisiting all the places over and over again, but I can't seem to find a option to go thru the gate with him. :( thx for the help !! Thank you so much for your comment and im so glad that you gave my game a chance. I know theres endless choices with how you chose to spend your free time so im honored. As for your question about chapter 3...Spoilers Because Mikail did not enter the ritual seeking enlightenment, he cannot pass through the door. If your friendship or romance bond is solid and confirmed, its possible to be reunited on the other side. ohh, i see!! spoiler below !! i got a bit scared that going thru the door would put an end in the relationship ( due to the warning that the relationship would reach an ending ), but if i understood correctly, that means that the relationship will just end in that "world", right? thank you for replying !! <3 I apologize if the warning was unclear. Allow me to clarify.* Spoilers* Once you go through the door, your relationship bond is set. There are no more oppertunities past the door to increase bond. I hope that helps clarify. Let me know if you have any more questions or concerns. I know I'm a little late to the party, but... can I just say, this is easily one of the best visual novels I've ever played. I won't lie, the primary reason that I got this game was because I had the opportunity to be gay; few are the opportunities where I can fully express my identity in a way I feel comfortable with - no scenes that were too heated, it just felt lovely! But the game itself? Wow. Just astounding. At first I was baffled; why was I being asked questions that would ultimately lead nowhere? Baffled, but honestly a bit pleased as well; while visual novels should have an important aspect that shows that your choices matter, sometimes choices that DON'T matter can be just as refreshing, as reminders that sometimes actions simply end and that is that. But that's the thing! The choices DID matter! They matter so much, because they subtly shape who Ilyon is; a calculating intellect? A seeker of power and influence? An emotionally-connected, empathetic man? Its honestly just incredible how the choices posed aren't ones that make me scratch my head and look up a walkthrough - they're the kind that leave me staring at the screen for 5 minutes, wondering what I would pick as a person and how I would want to proceed through this delve. This game genuinely made me introspective, looking into core traits of both Ilyon and myself and wondering how they came to be; was there any way to change them? If different choices were made in the past, would that have changed things, too? Incredible, simply incredible. Oh, and the icing on the cake, the soul contract characters. I'll be honest, I can't really speak about anyone but Mikail, but I will die for this thief who stole both mine and Ilyon's heart. He is so wonderfully grounded in reality; while Ilyon would stand there, saying "hmm yes, I do wonder on how something like this shaft might be a representation of my mind!" and Mikail would just be like "...okay, yeah, but lets be careful, the dirt is soft and the supports on this tunnel might not be stable." They just... balance each other out and they understand each other and ugh they're wonderful, I love love love them. The epilogue was fantastic, and I love the way the characters are designed. My run was Empathy with Romantic Bond Mikail, though I may go back and do something different one of these days! ...By different, I mean, like, Intellect Ilyon with Romantic Bond Mikail, there's no way I could ever bring myself to put Ilyon with anyone but Mikail haha Oh, and if I do that, you know what? I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything! I know I'm not the normal audience for a visual novel with romance elements; if I find a love interest (while there was no such choice in this one, I will admit to being soft for the childhood-friends-to-lovers trope lol), I latch on to them and don't let go. All of the other routes are now sacrilege and I will genuinely, honestly feel horrible and guilty if I play a different romance route - indicative of severe emotional issues? Almost certainly! But I can't help it; I find my fulfillment in visual novels with one character, and often just leave it there. The issue, of course, is that I often feel like I'm... missing out, somehow? Like, I don't WANT to pursue the other routes, but I almost feel like I have to. This game? Didn't even consider it for a second. Mikail and Mikail only, and it amazes me that the creator of this game has even more routes to choose from, Mikail's just felt so fantastic and whole, and when I completed the route I genuinely felt like I did it; I had no feelings of disappointment that I wouldn't know every route, I felt happy and content and would gladly do it again just for fun. Anyway, yeah, this comment ended up being more of a rambling expression of my love than anything; I am so amazed by this game, it is easily in my top 5 visual novels of all time. And I'm picky! I need things to be at least a little gay, that already removes, like, 90% of all visual novels! I am so glad you made this game, and I often go back just to play over certain scenes again and see Mikail and Ilyon being dorks with each other. *SPOILERS, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD* Okay, so like, this has been bothering me a bit and I genuinely spent an hour looking for a way to bring Mikail through The Door(tm) with me in the Catacombs because I couldn't bear the thought of leaving him behind. Is there a way to bring him as well? I know, I know, I should be happy with the Epilogue, but a part of me is sad that it seems like Mikail ended up hurt when Ilyon walks through The Door(tm) without him. Unless, of course, The Door(tm) is meant to represent something different from what I thought? I dunno, i'd be glad to hear from anyone! hi there and thanks so much for taking the time to share your experiences and thoughts about the characters, story and game. Truly this is why I am making these games ^_^. Im going to jump straight into spoilers so I dont forget to address your questions! Be warned spoilers ahead! The garden, tunnels and fortess are loose references to persona, ego and shadow. Ilyons outer mask of a calm and rational person, his understanding of himself as a person who has always desired to escape his sense of helplessness and his shame of being born somewhat a freak of nature. The door is representative of his minds eye opening to beyond his sense of self. Mikail in his current reality cannot follow him through the door because he is not seeking enlightenment, but was coerced into the ritual. Yet somehow their bond transcends the singular reality and another Mikail who was searching for enlightenment and choose to be there was able to help Ilyon beyond the door. He didnt become a different person, so he has somewhere in himself that same desire to find a higher meaning to his life and existence in the version that didnt pass the door, he just never pursued it. It becomes a curious question, at what point does decisions and experiences completely change who you are? In the case of power, empathy or logic, ilyon is still a variation of himself. But when his parents and cousin live, there is a different person "Caylis" whom Mikail does not recognize. Yet somehow both Caylis and Ilyon ended up in the ritual so maybe they are not so different lol. I'll let you decide ^_~ Wow, that is honestly awesome! As I suspected, the areas are significant aspects to his character, I was at least correct with my thoughts on the Garden haha; but everything else is very enlightening, and I'm glad to know that there is so much thought put into this that I am finding myself quite ignorant! You have, perhaps inadvertently, convinced me to play through the game again hahaha - I love this game and the symbolism it provides, I will definitely play through it again and probably obsess over details again. Thank you for the response, you did fantastic! Oh i forgot to mention, if you are only wanting to play mikails story i reccommend giving his friendship routes a chance as well. I strongly believe that friendships can be just as deep as romantic bonds and I tried very much to make all 6 possible endings with each companion unique, satisifying and reveal different aspects of their character. I made sure to enable the skip function everywhere i could XD. Haha, I will certainly consider it without a doubt! Mikail's story is so fascinating to me, i would love to delve into it with a new or altered perspective! When I play Soul Union once more, I will have many playthroughs to consider hahaha Hi, I have a question about the comic. Is it a prequel of the game or is it a first adaptation of the same story that the game, please? I haven't played the game yet but I wanted to know if I should read the comic first to better understand the story. Hi there, The comic is a stand alone short story that I wrote years before making this game. The game is only loosely influenced by previous iterations (some elements of world building are consistent.) I would suggest playing the game and reading the comic only if you are curious to see how the idea developed and changed over the years. Thank you so much for showing interest in my project. I'll read the comic after I play the game then. Thank you so much for responding so quickly and good continuation for the rest! <3 I'm having a blast for now. Thanks for making available this kind of quality threat to all ! May I give a few typos ? On Keska's route act2 (i'll quote them as is, so it'd be easier to copy/paste to look for it ~) "She didn't understand was how painful her calm, enduring kindness felt" "Ilyon...is it possible to buried down here" Thank you so very much for taking the time to quote the mistakes!! <3 It is very helpful! I'm super terrible at being able to catch my own grammar and spelling errors. I will be sure to add corrections to my next update. Thanks for tolerating them and I hope you can share with me if you find any more in the future. Best wishes!! <3<3<3 I'm more than happy to oblige ! In fact i'm glad there are stuff to get back to in a way, participating even a little is a privilege <3 (I totally don't mind glitches on quality material !) --- Keska act3 in her room : * A bug I just encoutered : if I pick the choice "In that case I'm looking forward to it" it get... a hug from Mikail ! That sure wasn't expected ! * there is a "portrait bug" where Ilyon portrait disapear, and Keska's replace him in the right (leaving the left side black). * "She tears the scroll into tiny pieces it" (and there is also a typo ~) * "Iv'e been thinking about what happened last time" * "Will you remember being like this when I wake?" * "You're right, Ilyon." * "Who knows? Things could get ugly from here on." * "Give me some time to prepare my thoughts." * "I've already shown you enough of myself I think." * "Now I've probably made this whole thing a much bigger deal than it needs to be." * "To his credit, he apologized." Typo in the chapter3 : * "I can't make an guarantees." Chapter 4 * crash "mromance is not defined ch04_star7shadow.rpy line 336" * "you have alot to learn about the upper echelons." : typo + she disapear and reapear without reason. * Typo : "I've gotten to used to those who are terribly reserved and easily offended." * Typo : "In the future I will do my best not to won't any unsolicited advice on that matter." Also I played all the game under GNU/Linux. Didn't met any bug. ______ My actual critics on the gameplay : * I entered 4 time Keska's room to get the dialogue unveiling. It was a bit weird to imagine going back 4 time in a row to talk things out. ^^' * The enigmas containing number were a bit hard to follow, and too easy to break by bruteforce. I think the best thing would have been to show all the hints on the screen while deciding, to encourage people to use their witt. It was too to cheat on try&error and too hard to go back to re-check the clues. - That's my feeling anyway. * The fact "you must check twice the same room to make stuff happen" is a bit weird. You get paranoic in the bad sense, developing the urge to double check everything after that in fear of missing optionnal dialogs. ...Not very immersive. :o * I didn't understood how I opened the "the baby casket" in the cells. I just got back to it and it was suddenly open without explaination ? My global feel : the design and animations are <3<3, the music nice, the story enticing, the romance <3. The biggest setback I had was the chapter4 where i HAD (i cannot let text unread) to watch all the possibile alternate universe. I was BOREEED senseless doing so. But I couldn't stop myself. And then, the end came and it was good - but I had suffered on the way. Partly my fault, I know - i can't understand how you wrote all theses declinaison without feeling sick at some point - I mean it's not about the text itself but the repetition. Darn ! My head hurts still ^^' Anyway, thanks for the trip ! I still don't get how you did all this game, in my head you were an army of artists, at least a talented designer, and one dedicaced writer, and a dev. ...And it's not the case apparently. I'm dumbfounded by the feat and I guess you can count me as one of your lowly fans now ~ The game reminded my of Avatar the last airbender (about ascension and one's bond) ; and the overall vibe to Planescape. Which both I adored. Hello, I don't know if you remember me, but I told you I'd read your visual novel a few weeks ago on reddit. Today, I finished my playthrough with Keska. It was a mesmerizing journey with beautiful art and atmospheric music that always set the right mood. Right from the start, I was intrigued. The idea of not knowing who the person whose head I'm inhabiting is and them not having any idea either, instantly piqued my interest. I loved the general structure of the story. I've mainly read visual novels that tell fairly linear stories with bigger choices that lead to major branches while this one lets you explore your surroundings to piece together Ilyon's past. The art style fit the story perfectly and you even went as far as animating so much of it - I'm impressed and can't imagine how many hours you spent getting it done. While there were some spelling errors, it wasn't enough to distract the reader or make the experience any less enjoyable. I believe I was at my lowest, motivation-wise, in the caves. The constant rumbling and warnings from the characters served their purpose perfectly in creating an oppressive atmosphere, but when the entire thing collapsed on me after I thought I hadn't even backtracked that much, I started to worry that maybe I can't get all the scenes and have to pick which ones to take along. Considering the sheer amount of rooms in that cave, that left me with a bit of frustration. In the end, I was wrong and could visit each cavern safely, so all that worrying was for nothing, but I still figured I'd let you know about my initial impression! Towards the end, I was getting impatient to finally get that conclusion I'd been working towards for so long. The fourth chapter may have been a tad longer than I would have expected, but overall, I still held my interest all the way to the end. Despite constantly learning more about Ilyon's background and the ritual, that sense of mystery never fully vanished. There were always new mysteries to figure out and you handed out new information at a great pace. I ended up ascending before going back to get the "friendship" ending with Keska. I'll certainly be returning to this VN once I've had some time to let it all settle and to have it feel fresh again for a second playthrough. Again, I loved this so much and I'm so glad I stumbled across your visual novel. I wish you all the best in your future projects and I'll definitely be recommending your story to others :) Yes! I remember that comment you gave me on reddit and it was very kind and encouraging of you. I'm so thankful for all the time you put into playing the game and giving me so much feedback! I'm glad the exploration based story telling worked for you. Once I got the coding worked out, I really preferred it over the more linear style of chapter 1. I think it helps give the player more a sense of agency in the story, as you might have in a roleplaying game or some other genre where you move an avatar from place to place. I really love text adventure exploration games (old stuff like shadowgate, lol) so I hope that influence comes through. Chapter 2 was the first chapter I was trying to make all the dialogue trigger from location from the base up so it was a bit of a struggle from the beginning and though it's been nerfed several times and I added hints it may not have been very well conceived from the start. I think chapter 3 has a much better overall 'flow' as I had learned a lot from mistakes in chapter 2 and I'd hate for people to give up before getting through the tunnels. I will brainstorm on it and see if I can make some more revisions. Thank you again so very much for taking the time to share your thoughts and experience with me! As this is my first full game, I really want to learn a lot from it. <3 beautiful... everything's just sooo beautiful ð­ i literally just finished mikail's route and i honestly feel like crying cause!!!! they're so damn cute together!! i really loved their banter and throughout the gameplay i just found myself wishing they'd be able to be happy with each other so bad... you REALLY made me feel a lot of feelings, so many feelings... firstly, i really like how you handle the way we can shape ilyon's personality and i also appreciate you letting us keep track of which trait we're leaning towards, that's specially helpful in case we want to see a different approach than the one we're walking towards. i also really appreciate the way you showed that every single character has multiple sides to them, no one is entirely good nor entirely bad (i'm looking at you, krey!). this honestly made me connect even more with the characters cause it genuinely feels live they're real people! anywayyy i'm really glad i gave this vn a try! the art is painfully pretty, every single song really matched the atmosphere and i definitely enjoyed being able to explore all those places, i'm living for the little chats here and there everytime we'd walk somewhere new cause a lot of them were so funny, but also so interesting to read! it was truly an awesome experience, definitely exceeded my expectations and after i get over how cute ilyon and mikail are, i sure am playing keska's route and all the others to come! (minor spoiler i think???) i was kinda confused when i got into the tunnels cause i killed ilyon after wandering around too much and i was like "..what am supposed to do, then?", but i didn't give up so if curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction really brought it back cause i was PUMPED when i found out what i had to do to get out of there lolol Hi there! Thank you so much for sharing your experience and thoughts. Also for the review! This was really nice to read when I got home from work. I'm so happy that you enjoyed the characters. I apologize for chapter 2. I struggled a bit with designing that area and I guess I might need to revisit it again. I'm curious which trait did you end up pursuing? Thank you again so much and I hope you enjoy Keska as well <3! ahh i'm glad my messy thoughts made your day a little bit better <3 but no need to apologize! i think the tunnels being designed that way kinda makes you used to the mechanics of the game, you know? i mean with having to revisit locations and stuff. it's just a matter of understanding how things work, because after that i didn't really have any other problem in the following chapters regarding where should i go or what should i do and ilyon's most proeminent trait was empathy! i was trying to go for power at first, but i guess i'm too soft hahah i plan on trying to go for different traits, though! just to see how it affects the story and ilyon's personality Ah! If you do have a chance to play through pursuing a different trait, I would love to get your opinion on how it was implemented. I haven't gotten that level of playthrough feedback yet. That is one area, I think I can gradually go back and flesh out more. Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions. <3 I gave it a try and I didn't expect to be so involved in the story. The animations were on point and they complimented the narrative very well. The concept of exploration and the definition of Ilyon's personality affecting the story were the reasons I stayed until the 'end'. I was having so much fun exploring that I nearly forgot that I could return to my companion's room to chat. I just returned there because I had missed a code and simply was looking everywhere and went to the companion's room by chance. Overall, I was surprised by the quality of this adventure. Hi there, Thanks for giving it a try and taking the time to share some feedback. I was afraid that some people might forget to revisit the companion's room and tried to make a "warning" before exiting chapter 3, but I'll try to revisit my approach. Would it be more helpful if the companion tells the protagonist to go to a certain place once the trust/attraction reaches every +10 milestone? I could create some conditional call statements for that. Thanks again so much. <3 I don't know if not talking to the companion has consequences later on. However, what you propose I could see it help me remember to visit the companion room. I like the idea of the companion suggesting or hinting at their need to talk with the protagonist once every milestone reached. I'm leaving this small suggestion that came to my mind right now: Each time the protagonist moves between floors, the system could check for the requirements needed to have a chat with the companion and would warn us once, every time they reach a certain milestone. I hope this helps in getting an idea. beautiful. this game is just wow ð­ (minor spoilers) i first downloaded this game thinking nothing much of it, but this game truly surprised me with how thorough and atmospheric the plot was. i finished mikail's story all in one go, and i admit i was especially lost during the tunnels. it was embarrassing as i couldn't exactly grasp the concept, but i managed to scrap through it, so im fairly happy with the ending and epilogue i received. ilyon is absolutely wonderful. i've fallen in love with his character and all the decisions that ultimately lead to what he truly believes in. it's nice how the mc of a story is actually logical and able to think for themselves. this isn't something i'm used to, but i certainly welcome it. and dare i say mikail has left an unforgettable impression on me as well? he has a solid character build, and i adore his little remarks from time to time. they tangle with ilyon's and it's cute to see them banter haha. they have become the objects of my affection. the amount of depth and knowledge i have gained from this experience is phenomenal. i'm not a very bright individual, but i can't help but dwell on the subjects that were touched on during the plot. it's pleasant to read through them and formulate your own opinion whilst also deciphering what ilyon, mikahil, and noctisse felt at times. which was hard since im not exactly skilled at figuring out stuff ðªyeah it just caused me to think over the entirety of my life choices. don't even get me started on the art style. it's divine. i love it so so much. i don't know what way i could specifically describe it but the artwork truly brings everything to life. everyone is gorgeous my brain can't handle it. !!! btw the little animations that cause them to sway back and forth is appreciated and i really am just in awe with the game over all. there's so much more thoughts i wish to unload i think i might as well write an essay on this game lol i only got a glimpse into keska's route so i'll definitely finish hers tomorrow!! also do you ever plan on making this game not free? honestly i feel a bit spoiled as i just played through this masterpiece with no fee whatsoever. the music was great too!! there's a lot to unpack but it really fit well with the scheme of the game I am eternally grateful to my long time friend Kerry. Music and sound is one area that I am completely clueless. Her contribution really helped with the mood I was going for. I'll pass on your compliment, thanks! Ah thank you so much for taking the time to write out your thoughts (and all the generous praise, you're too kind). And I'd love to read an essay someday lol. I grew up with more passive kind of literature, so I'm still struggling to be more direct and clear. I'm afraid that my writing might still come off as convoluted. If you feel spoiled by this free game, I am happy to be that random grandma figure who spoils XD others. I'm fortunate enough to be stable at this moment in my life. My goal in this project was to create a quality experience for that one person who might need a bit of reprieve from their everyday struggles. If you'd like to support this game, please help me spread the word so that it can reach that person. I appreciate you. <3 Wow, so much effort are put in this game. The art is beautiful and the ambiances are well made too. It's really interesting, and even if I haven't dig about how much choosing a logic/empath/power path changes the game yet, I'm impressed by the energy and the dedication put into it. The game is really interesting, and it's really good to play. However I am a bit confused about, maybe because I am not familiar enough with english or because the concepts was too hard for me to understand. I'm even more confused by the ending, is it possible to have a good one? If the screen does not turn red, is it still a wrong/bad end? !SPOILER! So far, the better ending I had is understanding what the ascension is with Mikail and either I choose I want to go out of here with Mikail or to ascend. I am confront to the pink inner eye who seems to kill me, or maybe It makes me acends and my sense of self is desintegrated I don't really know. I wonder if I miss something that could lead me to another end. Hi Gregg, Thank you so much for playing my game and taking the time to comment. The end of chapter 4 is very abrupt at the moment as the endings are not finished yet. I apologize for any confusion on this. SPOILER!! The "good endings" will be if you choose not to ascend and have agreed to either a friendship or romance connection. These endings are not implemented yet, as there are 6 possible outcomes per companion, depending on your highest attribute (power, logic, empathy) and relationship status. I hope to including all endings in my next update. Thank you again very much for your feedback! It's my pleasure. Thanks for the answer, it's clearer for me now. And good luck for the continuation. I have no doubt it will be super interesting and I look forward to play this game again with the new update. Hi there, I just wanted to update this reply. The endings are now implemented so I hope the story will be less confusing. Let me know if you have any issues. Thanks again so much! Hi, Oh great, thank you. It will be a pleasure to play again, I'll let you know if any issues or feedback I can give. Thanks you for your hard work! Just adding my bit to helping everyone can see this is a great game to try. As I said in my comment review (which I intend to update when I get to play a later version.) I found this a very enjoyable experience. The art-style, with the animations, and writing gave it a beautifully eerie atmosphere very dreamlike which, naturally, suits the story. The drawing style reminded me a little off a storytellers puppets, in a good way, stylized and quite beautiful. So I am really looking forward to how this develops. Particularly looking forward to meeting the priestess. (I studied spirituality and have a lot of interest in that). I like how the main character can develop more empathy but does not stop being analytical. It meant that there was not that awful swing with choices where a character can feel just warped between extremes. Every choice felt like an authentic development of a single well written personality. I am personally a very visual kind of person so I think less about the music, but certainly nothing felt wrong about how it supported the telling of the story. For the moment I am trying to hold back as I know I will frustrate myself if I hit the content wall. But probably I am going to dip back in soon as it really was unique. Wish I could do more to support this project, but certainly happy to give it the full thumbs up. Keep doing what you are doing it is highly enjoyable and your effort and art is appreciated. I re-read these kinds of encouraging words over and over again, whenever I start to feel lost. Your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you so very much for your thoughtful and thorough comment and review. I really really love the interactions between the characters :D The conversations really hit the mark for me, whether it was the fun little banter as they explored or the more emotional scenes that really resonated with me. I can definitely see the effort that went into every part of this, and it paid off! I'm really looking forward to seeing how it all comes together when it's finished :) I'm so glad to hear you enjoyed the dialogue between the characters. I was trying to make it seem natural while also giving the player choice. Also trying to strike a balance between developing characters and avoid too much padding. It's hard for me to tell how (un)successful I was. I'm so happy to hear you say that there were scenes that resonated with you. Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your thoughts! I love all the musical choices and subtle animations that bring this story to life! The choices you're given feel very open-ended and there's a consistent feeling of wonder and mystery established from the very start. It makes you want to keep delving deeper into the intriguing world of the game. I'll definitely be following this project as it develops <3 Thank you so much for trying my game! Your feedback means a lot to me. I have been building things up for awhile, so I am looking forward to drawing the conclusion. I hope it will be satisfying. I like your presentation, except that all but one of the gameâs screenshots have been uploaded in a rather small resolution. While I can still zoom them in my browser I wish I didnât have to . Furthermore, less experienced surfers and cruisers of the internet, who might be only interested in the games, might not know how to. Hi Wechenbetelly, Thanks for bringing this to my attention. It's a bit odd, because I could have sworn I just did a screen capture the same way from the same computer each time. I just assumed that was the way itch.io displayed the images. I will try to correct this issue when I have time tomorrow. Thanks again so much for your input! That was a fast response. :) I hope you can get that sorted out without much effort, but just in case: There is a well-received guide on itch that describesâ¦ I think pretty much everything that there is to know in that regard - I thinkâ¦ Iâm not publishing anything on itch myself right now so Iâve only glossed over it so far. Just to make that clear: Iâm not suggesting you would need it, but in case you would want to have a look, there is already a link to the guide on my creator page. (I would feel guilty about just plastering the link here.) Hi Again, Thanks for your advice. I tried to reload images and have tested on two different devices and I believe the issue should be resolved. Let me know if you have any more suggestions or notice any issues. Thanks!</TEXT>

It scared me a lot with the screams in the basement... 10/10 GAMEPLAY in French That scream in the basement caught us both off guard. Great game! 8/10 Gameplay starts: 12:31 Super creepy ! Good job This is very scary, has good background music, and is a great work. Thank you for your wonderful workâª Loved this game, had played while back and wanted to share my experience here. This game was legit terrifying, the sounds the SCP made and when I finally saw her! Very nice graphics as well! It's game #2 in my video. I only play horror games on my channel so this was perfect! Starts at 7:25 I actually can't remember the last time I ever screamed like this from a game! This SCP experience was awesome! The atmosphere was amazing, the tension and buildup was well executed, and the little tid-bits that added more to the game was great. If you have other games, I'll check them out for sure! Please check out my gameplay and consider subscribing if you enjoyed it! thanks man, glad you liked it <3 new game should drop soon enough Awesome! Canât wait to girly scream again lol! It was a really fun game and had some nice horror elements to it. My favorite part of it was the unpredictability with the game. Overall, great work! thank you! glad u liked it <3 Really nice & short horror Game. It has some scary moments and the SCP 847 looks really terrifing. Not convinced yet? Take a peek at the gameplay: thanks for playing, glad u liked it <3 The game could have been a bit more scary, but it's quite cool. I had a pretty good time with it. You can watch my video here: Any Content Creators looking forward to collab in future videos? Hit my Instagram @Mickydezz hello kitty girl really scary Awesome SCP as usual! The atmosphere is what it's all about in this one! this game scared the pants off me muptiple times, some of the hardest jumps/screams I ever did (especially on camera) thanks for the great youtube content ( gameplay starts at 1:05) glad you liked it <3 Very enjoyable game. Didn't really understand it but I did enjoy it. Thanks for making it :) It`s really scary game. This is my first introduction to what an SCP is. Awesome game! Following GhostMasaki now! Absolutely loved this! Nice atmosphere and some genuinely creepy moments. I'm not hugely familiar with SCP so some parts were maybe lost on me but that didn't stop from being creeped out. I did a play through on my channel if you want to see my first-hand reactions (starts at 44:52). Thanks so much and please keep up the good work. Love SCP stuff and this game is one of the best SCP games ive ever seen! Got a good few super spooks as well! Especially love including the other SCP in it! Very well done! Hope you enjoy the video That was freaking awsome!! I literally was so terrified at 1 point i thought i might need to change myself great job!! <3 The sound effects on this game were next level and really spooked me to my core. Very much worth the download and play! I was very happy to add it to my series on youtube! thanks <3 Okay, that one got me good a couple of times haha. Well done, I'd love to see anymore SCP work you do as well! thank you, glad u liked it <3 That was really creepy and interesting, well done dev! thanks <3 Nice scp game! Audio was amazing! good horror game i say! thanks <3 It's been a long time since I've played a scary game and this got me. Great build up, fantastic game. I have one piece of constructive criticism however. During the part where you release the water pressure taking control away from the player removes the suspense thus losing the effectiveness. I'd simply recommend not forcing the players camera to aim places since it means that anything bad that happens at that point isn't the players fault and kind of loses it's weight. thanks for playing <3 ya, I thought about that too and never again. Those where the most gut-wrenching screams I've ever heard. Who produced those for you if you don't mind me asking? Psychiatric Hospital - Madness Why'd you smash SCP 847 and SCP 606? who knows You did it for no reason? It doesn't really make sense A really fun game I enjoyed it quite a lot !!! Good job I didn,t get a good scare in a while :D A truly slow build anxiety inducer. Freaked me out far more than most games on Itch. Loved it! thanks <3 a small, really cool game, it was really fun to play. good mood and cool puzzle i want more! Have a nice Day- Balowner German Youtuber thanks <3 and soon enough. <3</TEXT>

XD Here's my channel for other games I have played. https://www.youtube.com/@Levont It's not perfect by any means, but I found this to be a lot of fun. Pretty spooky game that had me questioning everything. Love the realistic graphics. I think the best part was the cat though. Great work! Played your game, and I think it was pretty solid. I had a few situations not knowing what to do next, so I examined everything very thorough multiple times. I would recommend the tasks to be either shown on the screen as objectives, or within a journal or something. Your game is the second in my video and starts at 12:44 Pretty good game.

You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. bought the bundle but this game does not run well at all. it's also not very good. maybe the others are better. Thanks. Without knowing your system specs I'd recommend adjusting FPS cap, volumetrics and shadow render distance & texture quality in the game settings and make sure any background programs are off and run the .exe as admin. The game runs fine for most people but it does require a decent rig. Hopefully you will enjoy it then! Thank you for your feedback. ð» Thanks for playing glad you enjoyed the game! Wish I could've gotten to experience the game to its fullest degree but no matter what settings i changed or what i did i couldnt get it to stop skipping and stuttering. im running a 4070 super gpu with a 7800x3d cpu with 64gb ram so i doubt thats the issue. Idk how these things work but i would just like a refund for it Hello. Try redownloading the game, make sure to run the .exe as admin and most importantly, If you reduce FPS cap, Texture Quality, volumetrics and especially shadow render distance, should do the largest difference in terms of performance, but you shouldn't have this issue with your rig. My sincerest apologies! Hope this helps. I'll give it a try, thank you! This was SO awesome! I did have to run around a bit towards the end to trigger the appearances in the room, and I think I might have missed some story somewhere? But honestly this was an amazing experience--terrifying the whole way! Nice playthrough! Glad you enjoyed the game so much! You did miss a bit of story, and some of the anomalies do happen in sequences. Thanks for playing! Awww darnit! I'm usually such a lore goblin I find all the bits and bobs of story. But with this game I think the atmosphere had me so on edge I couldn't really do that! Y'all had me constantly scared something was gonna run at me. T_T Thanks for playing and I'm glad you enjoyed the game! scary.. i approve ;) Thanks :) That house is creepy as hell! I always love the way your games look. I had some challenges along the way in this one but it wasn't too tough to figure out after fumbling around haha. Thanks for the fun, my friend! Hey glad you enjoyed the game and thanks for your support my friend really enjoyed the playthrough! This Game is Amazing, Best indie horror I've played. I loved the game design, the eerie atmosphere, the puzzles and the jump scares. The story adds the cherry on top.

Thank you so much and glad you really took your time to dive deep into the game and had a great time with both Miremind & Sinbound.

Thanks for playing as always my friend and glad you enjoyed the game! This game did gave me the spook i love the story of it great job! Glad you found the game scary and the story interesting, thanks for checking out my work! Hi, do you plan on adding translations to your game? i would like to help with Turkish translation (for free) At this moment I can't say. But you can DM me on X @AzaGameStudio for enquiries thank you! This game was great!Definitely recommend!Eventhou I almost had a heart attack with these jumpscares lol. Plays very similar to Sinbound which is a game I absolutely loved. Really looking forward to the next game. Keep up the great work. :) Thank you so much for playing glad you enjoyed playing both Miremind & Sinbound! Btw i saw you were on v1.0, i did upgrade the build to v1.1. Anyway cheers and can't wait to watch you play Dead Faces New Demo once it launches!! Hey yeah, I played the game less than 24hrs it was release so I wasnât aware there was an updates version :/. Nonetheless I enjoyed it. Iâve played the old demo for Dead Faces ages ago, (one of my old YouTube videos)looking forward to the new one :). It's alright was just a small update, thanks for your feedback as well! Glad you enjoyed it and think your really gonna enjoy the new demo of Dead Faces too! The game was amazing. Creepy setting, good puzzles and well placed jumpscares. Thank you so much for your support and glad you enjoyed the game! Be on the lookout for the new demo of Dead Faces next month! Cheers. LOVING THIS GAME SO SO MUCH! I do hope that you plan to keep adding to this one. Thank you very much! This is a standalone full game, but just pushed a small update https://azagamestudio.itch.io/miremind/devlog/1004224/small-update-v11 This game is one of my top favorite horror games to date.. very well done! Here is my playthrough Glad you enjoyed the game, thanks for checking it out and a very nice play through as well! Id love to play it but its way choppy for me . rtx 4070 and 32gig DDR4 ram. dont know what goin on but i really wanna play it. make sure chrome is off.. i had the same issue but realized chrome was destroying my resources. no problems after. i have a 3080 sweet, thanks! ill try it right now! Fast update. "Texture Quality" i set it to Half size. everything else is maxed out butter smooth now! Hey glad you figured it out! Chrome does take up a lot of Ram. If you reduce FPS cap, volumetrics and especially shadow render distance, should do the largest difference in terms of performance. This game is a remarkable achievement in the horror genre, serving as a significant source of inspiration. It stands out as one of the most exceptional horror games I have experienced in recent years. Thank you very much for your support and I'm glad you find my game so intriguing!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Project_Arktik</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows Project Arktik is a short psychological horror experience where you, the player, become part of a larger, state-controlled experiment on "dream control", and the place you arrive to work at slowly becomes your prison. I made this game by myself in a about 2 and a half months, (it could be less if not for my inexperience), Most of the sounds, models, textures and animations are made by myself, those that aren't are from: Sketchfab (models) , Freesound (audio) , AmbientCG (textures) and Mixamo (animations). Controls: Update: Made the game a bit lighter, which was main "turn off" point for some players, i hope this "patch" fixes it; Estimated playtime: 35 - 45 minutes Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Got any English translations for the Czech on the posters? Oh, it's Serbian, obvious one is No smoking, other ones are some standard paroles like work, people and stuff Huge thanks for playing my game! Vuk, I know i've left some rude comments in the past but I quite enjoyed this game. Your newer games lack the personality and effort that this one contains. I know you wont see this most likely but PLEASE make more games like this! Thanks, one question only, what really was the point of some of those "rude" comments? I enjoy chaos and hate seeing the bright future of a Vukky such as yourself going to slop. Well here we are again, and I still really have no Idea what this is about Overall great game! Impressing that it is your first one! The dithering was a bit too much for my eyes and I wish I could get some clarity storywise (was it some kind of a cult? Or was it alien light orbs?) The setting and the nightmarish surreal atmosphere were amazing! They sucked me in from the start! Huge thanks for playing my first game, I didn't have much experience, dithering hid many visual lacks the game has, and story is an overall mess that I tried to connect somehow :) , and you are right, it is supposed to be some sort of a cult or organisation brainwashing people through their dreams, I read 1984 shortly before making the game and was inspired by that "all knowing dystopian regime" and similar stuff, it shows in the game, glad that you liked it and wish you all the best! I played every one of your games, should I go out and touch grass? I strongly do not recommend touching grass, it takes way too much time and there are so many great games on Itch to spend your time on, jokes aside, huge thanks for playing them! And I really hope that you liked my catalogue! visuals and scenarios were spetacular, the story was terribly bad, and the scripting could be better, but nice game, got me going from beginning to end Sorry, it was my first game ever and I learned a lot since its okay! keep on the good work my friend!! :) This one was my favorite so far! Love your games! Thank you so much! this game was crazy!!!!i enjoyed it alot i took my time with it outstanding job! Thank you so much! PT/BR Eu nÃ£o entendi quase nada da histÃ³ria, mas gostei muito de cada cenÃ¡rio e da interaÃ§Ã£o com o mundo em si. Thank you very much! seu burro viado nao sabe falar ingles e vem reclamar com o criador eu te odeio que isso bro Wtf? Updated horror game mobile ada yang apa bisa it's okay ke gamenyað placec gamenya 1 Danke fÃ¼r dein Spiel. Es hat SpaÃ gemacht, war aber irgendwie etwas verwirrend :D Thanks for playing! It's literally like a mixture of unexlpained and illogic dreams, which shows impressive psychological horror. Anyway, I love the unknown and weird atmosphere and hope for more masterpieces of this style. wow. it's amazing. I played it while I live in MN, and it's totally vibe game, as others yours game. Good job, I really liked! 2 things: 1) Movement would like faster) 2) Building B has no collider) Thanks for the compliments and feedback! It really means a lot! I'll do my best to fix those issues in my future works! What a strange and incredibly unique experience this game was! Great while also distressing atmosphere and uncomfortable in the best kinda way. Thank you very much for playing, I'm glad it was enjoyable experience! Wish you all the best So I have no idea how close to the end of the game I was, cause I totally broke it in a way that made it unplayable. You might want to make your walls less fragile hahaha. Other than that though, this was pretty interesting though Iâd be lying if I said I fully understood what it was about (and not seeing the end probably didnât help). So uhhh sorry I broke your game lmao Haha, it had to do with my mediocre scripting abilities and no matter what I cluldn't make some stuff to work, first project I guess, I'm glad it was somewhat enjoyable experience and thank you very much for playing it! Amazing game really enjoyed it from start to finish definitely looking forward to play more of your games Hello, again! Wanted to leave a quick note about your game being in top 10 list of best indie horror games. My channel isn't huge, but I really appreciate the work you've put in your game. Best of luck with the future games! thank you so much man!, I really appreciate it, especially since you were the first one to play my game and make a whole video on it, thank you so much! THEY ARE IN MY DREAMS | Project Arktik really enjoyed this game. It was a fun experience and I was throughly creeped out!! Thank you very much for playing, posting and enjoying my game! where can I find such music? which sounded the day after you wake up? (the game went 10\10) Thanks for kind words and sorry for late reply, music is heavily distorted and "modified" version of soviet anthem, thanks for playing and enjoying my game! It was a cool game and concept. how ever I broke the game a lot by accident. other then that I liked it. Thanks for playing it, game probably has some more bugs that no one experienced yet and I'm really sorry to hear that, but that was my first project and I'm more than happy to learn from my mistakes and make more enjoyable and overall better experiences! Story is, well, a bit out there but i tried to make it as enjoyable as possible, thank you very much for playing my game, glad you liked atmosphere! Honestly a pretty enjoyable game with a weird experience that kept you intrigued and guessing what was going to happen next. Only complaints is it was pretty dark and I didn't really understand the story aspect. Thank you very much for playing my game and making whole playthrough video about it, I couldn't appreciate it more! I'm aware of things that should be improved, most of them story-wise, thanks again for playing my game! Thank you for making an enjoyable experience and good luck in whatever you make next! buen juego aunque confuso Gracias por jugar! Loved the eeriness of the game. Great work! Pozdrav iz Vojvodine! Veliko hvala! Very interesting and atmospheric game. Really impressive plot. Congrats! ALL ENDINGS HERE: Thank you so much for playing and uploading playthroughs of my game! What a solid experience this was! Loved the whole game throughout and never had a singler issue. Except for overcomplicating the numbers thing lol. Made a video on it. Oh thanks for letting me know! And thank you very much for kind words and playing my game on your channel! I did run into an issue with Microsoft Defender, but it was clearly a false positive since it didnât flag anything after I extracted the files. Iâd suggest compressing the game files in a ZIP format instead—this might help avoid the issue. That might be the problem, I'll look it up a bit more, thanks for making video and playing my game! Seems pretty good acording to the comments. But a virus is detected by windows defender. There isn't any virus in game files, I downloaded quite a few games from Itch and sometimes warning appears about "Unknown author, unauthorized software" etc., game file I uploaded is clean but I understand your concern, thanks for commenting. It's not a lack of confidence. I download game from itch like every days. But last year I've got hacked (not from itch) and after that my pc got multiples viruses. So if my pc said "No" it's gonna be a "No". Pretty disabling for me but I'd rather safety that fun. And just to had some more explanations, my Windows defender blocked the download, so I can't even have your game :( So sorry it happened to you, internet is a nasty place sometimes and those hackers who live off leeching others are worst kind of people The visual style of this game is superb! Such good PSX screen tearing and I love the halftone pixelated look! So cool :) Amazing work! Thank you so much! I did my best to make it look as good as possible and I'm really happy you liked it! Played the game, love the ambient, gives you the clasic vhs horror games vibe, and got a few jumpscares out of it, i get the story the game was aiming for, i like the idea, i reccomend playing in the darker room for the best experince cuz gamma is low but other than that it has potential , definetly reccomend playing this. T hank you very much! Thanks for makind a video on my game! thanks broo Muchas gracias por jugar y escribir una buena reseÃ±a, Â¡saludos! so cool Managed to get the Good Ending. I liked the cold, oppressive atmosphere you created and I'm fascinated by anything Soviet-related so that's also a plus. Like others have said, I had a hard time following the story. I'd suggest including more notes to help flesh out what's happening. I just had to guess at the plot and I probably wasn't correct. You've said you "lightened" up the game but jeez man-- it's still super dark. Too dark to see half the time. Maybe a flashlight or something? I did enjoy this however, and I think you've shown a lot of potential here. Keep at it and the next one will be even better I'm sure. Cheers. Thanks man, I'll patch it up as much as I can, story is kinda unhinged (It changed quite few times during development so at the end I just had to connect it somehow) Thank you for suggestions and thank you for playing my game! what is this? Thats player's job, the 5 x 5 numbers on the left part are matrix and you have to input number sequences, you can find them in vertical columns, horizontal rows or diagonals, in screenshot you provided combination is 1 2 3 4 5, its middle column one, thanks for commenting, I'm here to help I've finished the game!Nice interesting! Hi,this game was great I like it and your first game nice! but there was this I fell through the world when I was checking the poster on the board downstairs but still I like the game anyway well done keep it up! So sorry it happened, most likely some weird rigidbody and wall collision behaviour, I'll tend to fix it in next patch, thanks for playing my game and thanks for kind words The game reminded me of Funeralopolis: Last Days if it was crossed with a hint of old-school survival horror. I would recommend getting rid of the robotic voice acting. It's commonly used and absolutely never lands for me. Just kills immersion which would otherwise be preserved well enough with the captions that are already present. The remaining criticisms I could've had were already addressed by Niven Hedinger. Thanks for commenting, "Voice acting" was made with "Software Automatic Mouth (SAM)" and you are right, it isn't the best option to use, i just found it as easiest method for my first project. I learned from my mistakes and am already working on next, I hope way better project. Thanks From haunting visuals to eerie atmosphere with a splash of super darkness, which ruined the immersion for me - not bad. To start with, I have huge respect towards the developer as most of the things in the game were made by them and the quality of the game is unmatched to any other games with similar story and atmosphere - great points for that. The visuals were breathtaking and really put me in the mood of isolation, desperation and raw, visceral feeling of fear. I was really immersed in the game and somewhat enjoyed the dream sequences. With that said, I didn't love the game. Some parts really dragged for too long, the note and conversations were too short to grasp the story, leaving me with a wonder of what I've just experienced. This can be good if you try to have the ambiguity in the game, but not always, it is a balance, which is hard to nail. The dream sequences were too dark, the motion blur really didn't suit the game and the load feature makes no sense if the player fails without warning and has to start the game again. I would suggest maybe having an autosave or checkpoint system. Despite these drawbacks, the game's unique concept and atmosphere made it a memorable experience. It was alright for me and I definitely recommend checking it out. Best of luck with the future projects! Thank you very much! I am aware of all the things that should be worked on and I intend to fix them, and make game more memorable and unique experience, This is my first ever finished game and I can't say with words how grateful I am for somebody reviewing my game with such effort, thank you again! Already have idea for the next game, more "articulated", organized and I hope overall better experience for the player. Thank you again for playing and reviewing my game, I just checked your game "Silenced" it was nice Just gave you a follow and I can't wait for the next game. Again, you've done a masterful job and I wish all the best to you! Really liked that depressed vibe! Really nice game Thanks !</TEXT>

Short niche horror game. However, the game does give a grim history at the end. Glad it wasn't just "boom jumpscare" and then end credit. Nice short game definitely looking forward to play more of your games nice and short game :D Finally gotten round to ppaying Fractured! Ep 1 & 2. I thought these werent too bad, i liked the build up of eerieness, like with that guy in the shop following you around and wanted to get his bag in his car.. i knew where it was going. Only thing, after doing the shopping, she did repeat the "i cant leave yet" line and it was a bit difficult to see some items as it was dark. But this does spread awareness of stranger danger. but I thought this wasn't bad. Episode 1 is at 00:45! Keep up the good work! there is no way to help the guy with the cast, i tried walking 360 around his car and clicking everything, all he says is him hmmmm and she says I cAn'T jUsT lEavE i NeEd To BuY GrOcErIeS, despite the fact she literally just bought them i always loveee spreading awareness and teaching people via video games lol. thanks so much fenixapple!! Amei o jogo — a jogabilidade Ã© fluida, a dublagem estÃ¡ excelente e o clima de tensÃ£o Ã© sutil, mas cresce de forma impecÃ¡vel conforme a histÃ³ria avanÃ§a. A atmosfera Ã© imersiva e o estilo PSX dÃ¡ o tom perfeito para o tipo de terror que prende mais pela mente do que pelos sustos. Achei apenas um pouco escuro em alguns momentos, mas nada que atrapalhe a experiÃªncia. 10/10 , sem dÃºvidas. ð Ansiosa pelos prÃ³ximos episÃ³dios! Valeu, Dev! Â¡Felicidades por el juego! WWWW GAME - A good game that puts us in the shoes of a character who meets a character whose name will not be unknown. really random game.. but not bad.. also i hope to be full time on youtube one day! short and creepy as hell! really enjoyed this one. Pretty creepy, a little too dark… The Ordinary Shopping Trip Turns Nightmarish | Fractured Short but fun game, as a tip I would say that maybe you could add a volume change option, because it was really loud.

That twist at the end was the last thing I ever expected... SOLID horror game, especially for how short it was Great little short game! Check out the video This game was really cool nice twist at the end i did not know the killer was him I was actually impressed by how well made this game was. The art style/graphics look really great and I especially love the voice acting. The tension was being built up the whole time and it had me on edge. Good job. Here's my gameplay of it. It starts at 4:21 Cool =) You seem... familiar... this was solid keep working on your craft and you will get better.. better than even fears to fathom lol we all would love to see that. More competition = better games. Edit: Wanted to say this real quick don't let the intro judge how I feel on the entire game I really meant what I said it's really good for what it is I actually enjoyed it. Ending is predictable but the twist was really good. Wish it was longer. 8/10 i would love to see an series about serial killers, honestly, i think it would go viral. i played your game (its the second game) , hope u enjoy! I really enjoyed this experience. The ending was extremely predictable but the twist was phenomenal! Excited to play the future Fractured episodes! Gameplay starts at 24:39 FUN GAME W game, definitely wish it was longer! was so good Basing this on the real kidnappings of a real person is really gross and exploitative. its spreading awareness to people who have never seen it before too short... SHORT GAME BUT DEFINITELY A GOOD GAME! KEEP IT UP. it short but I don't know why I feel how this short it too real. In real life it not easy like game that we can survive from killer or someone help us Bing badaBOOM</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows https://store.steampowered.com/app/4018200/Youve_Got_a_Package You are a young and talented writer. One evening, someone leaves a mysterious box on your doorstep. Whatâs inside will turn your life into a living nightmare... "Better not to open it…" You are Clark — a young and acclaimed writer whose debut novel became an international bestseller. Fame, money, recognition — he had it all. But now, a year has passed, and Clark hasnât written a single word. A relentless creative block consumes him from the inside. Alone in his luxurious mansion, he struggles to put even a sentence on paper… and fails every time. One sleepless night, the doorbell rings. On the porch, Clark finds a mysterious package with no sender. From that moment on, his life begins to spiral into a nightmare far darker than any writerâs block. Whatâs inside the box? And more importantly… what happens once you open it? Average Demo time: 10 - 15 minutes The full version of the game will be approximately 50 minutes long. âYouâve Got a Packageâ is a short horror game in the walking simulator and exploration genre. You are about to live through the most nightmarish night of your life. Unspeakable horrors and terrors will crawl out from the darkness, eager to feast on your sticky fear. By unleashing an ancient demon, youâll be dragged straight into a living Hell — and nothing will help you escape alive or unharmed.

<TITLE>EMPTY HEAD</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows DISCLAIMER: EMPTY HEAD contains violent and bloody elements. This game is the result of the author's creation and imagination. EMPTY HEAD [Psychological Horror - Mystery] I've been inspired from other indie horror games such as The Cat Lady and Downfall (Remigiusz Michalski) and from my love for the psychological horror genre. The plot is entirely made up by me. Plot: In the small hamlet of Elkedor lives the Baker family, isolated and almost ''inexistent'' for the townsfolk. Arold, family man and lawyer with no fame, enters in a difficult time of his life between alcoholism and a falling apart marriage. His days began getting filled by drinking more and more, while his wife and their two children, Sarah and Thomas, started to get detached and cold. One night the two went missing. Desperate at the thought of losing them he decided to investigate until, thanks to clues found in the house, succeeds in finding a hidden passage. Lies, compulsions, and hatred are the summary of what underlies in the ambitious Baker family. The full game features: Blood | Alcohol Use | Disturbing Elements Multiple Endings ( True Ending - Neutral Ending - Bad Ending ) 1-2 Hours of Gameplay Puzzles Walkthrough (English) - Walkthrough (Italian) !!! SPOILER WARNINGS !!! Suicidal thoughts, Depression, Mentions of domestic abuse, Scopophobia, Organs Characters: Arold Baker: Laura's husband and father of Sarah and Thomas. Brown hair, mustache and beard, thin, brown eyes. Our protagonist. A realist and friendly man, but sometimes he may seem rude. Laura Baker: Arold's wife and mother of Sarah and Thomas. Short black hair, thin, blue eyes. An insecure and weak woman, but she would do anything for her family. She can't stand lots of things, including her husband's drinking problems. Sarah Baker: Arold and Laura's daughter, young sister of Thomas. Black hair tied up in two small ribbons, thin, green eyes. Sarah has her head in the clouds half the time and shows no emotion whatsoever. Considered ''The mute girl'' in the hamlet. Her favourite plush is a teddy bear called ''Leo''. Thomas Baker: Arold and Laura's son, big brother of Sarah. Brown hair, thin, green eyes. Thomas has a big passion for insects and his dream is to study entomology. He's cheerful and a little careless, his dad hopes he will be a successful lawyer. And many others... Minor Characters: Hanna Meekins: Senior citizen of Elkedor, she lost her husband due to an incurable disease. She isn't quite sympathetic with the Baker family.

Spanish-speaking players would really appreciate it. L-O-V-E I-T! I had so much fun. The story is incredible and so good. I love this kind of games and this one is really good :) Its the all game (its in italian) Grazie di cuore â¥ sono felice che ti sia piaciuto I loved it! The story, the characters, and the puzzles were amazing! I was stumped a few times with some puzzles but in the end it wasn't too frustrating to solve. This is also the first RPG game I've ever finished so that says a lot, I also love the character's designs! I loved White Fox's especially. I'm so glad you loved my game dear! Thank you â¥ Part 3 and all endings: Part 2: I must say, I'm very intrigued to see where this goes. Definitely revisiting it soon. love the old school textures, makes me nostalgic I'm glad! This.. It's a masterpiece! I loved it. Thanks a lot! â¥ i have finished the game like by 2 minutes. i litterally loved it,simple and really good. i'm starting to make games and i want to start by rpg maker games(i have rpg maker mv), i'm playing some games to learn how they work,i'm discovering treasures like yours. thank you for made this,continue like this,trust me!!! _kappoVG Thank you! It means a lot to me, I can't wait to play your games as well Default rpg maker textures, boring same old cliche, awful scares. Just feels like something cheap and quickly thrown together. Thanks anyway for trying it I enjoyed the game and the story was well structured. The horror sensation feels a bit, but my suggestion should be to add more sound effects. Music also needs to be added to moments of horror or sadness. I made the gameplay on Youtube, you can watch it if you want. Hi! Thanks for the video and for the suggestions, I appreciate them ^^ i loved this game <3 Thank youuu~ I love this game, It is wonderful. Thanks a lot! <3 Really liked this game. Amazing game with awesome art and plot 100% recommend!! Yo the plot of this game is amazing! im crying so hard holy crap. I know i shouldn't be saying this, but My dad has been acting insane since im 11 years old, he screams with me and hits everything he sees with his own hands, and i have a trauma because of it. And no, i dont hate him. His life has been a hell in a long time, his ex-wife was a crazy woman who tortured his child, his 13 years old daughter has depression, anxiety and ocd, has bad notes at school and suffered bullying last year (I'm okay at school now, thank god). He his way too stressed because of his daughter, so he screams everytime to feel a bit better. And now he has to take care of his ex-wife's son, who is 20 years old, which needs to recover from a 8 year depression. I realized my dad is suffering so much, so everytime i make him worry about me, i cut myself as a punishment. I know this is wrong and it makes him worry even more about me, but i feel like i DESERVE it. I'm sorry for venting though. Arold made me remind of the problems I've been hiding from myself. Thanks for making this game, now I know I don't have to hide my problems, but solve them and continue my happy life. this game looks awesome i wish it was mac compatible TT me and my boyfriend played this together and we had tons of fun :) very nice game! and i'd hope to see more games from you in the future! Thank you guys! I really appreciate it :) SING US A SONG YOUR THE SHAWDOWMAN! Thanks for the video! Of course my man! You made something solid here. :{) Yikes, I'm having trouble with the part with all the mirrors. I'm mega stuck. But!! other than that, it is a really good game, it has such a great atmosphere, it really made me sit there and just stare at the screen in awe. If you examine all the mirrors, you'll see that there are some symbols that are connected with numbers . You have to use them to open the door :3. Let me know if you need further help~ This game was amazing! it had a great plot, great music, and very emotional. It was a great RPG game! Thank you so much! Enjoyed it a lot, pretty long for an rpgmaker horror game as well (2.5 hours in my case to 100% it and see all the endings). Hoping you'll make more games like this in the future because I'll always enjoy playing horror rpgmaker games. Thanks a lot! Really enjoyed it! Loved the characters and the music and the feels Can't wait to see what else you make Thank you! This was so much fun!! I got all the endings! Thank you for spending your time to make this incredible game for us to play~ :D I'm glad you guys liked it! I couldn't get the key to work in the room with the dead cat, after meeting white fox. You have to use the first key with the locker ^^ Whoops, I completely forgot about that. Thank you! Don't worry! If you get stuck again, here's the full walkthrough :3 Hey, I really liked the idea even though the story telling confused me at times. I did a little video on it: Thanks for the video! It's meant to be like that at the beginning :P Did you make this in VX Ace? Yes! You think it'll be possible for me to help bring it over to RPG Maker MV? Thanks for the offer, but there's no need for that ^^ You sure? I really liked this game. Great job! I have a question: Is the music original? I am wondering if I should fight the copyright claims on my video. Thanks! Thank you! The music I used was made by my composer and some of them were also free resource. You don't have to worry about the copyright :) Can i post my gameplay for this game? :) on my utube channel? Of course! :3 This is an interesting game so far. Well done. Thank you! Here's the second video and I really like how you made use of the empty space outside of the play area to add in a bit more of a creep factor in. Here's the last video for the game. I wish there was a bit more of a horror effect in the game towards the end. But that said, it's a good game. I can understand, however I tried to focus more on the story ^^ Man I loved that too I loved it! Thanks sweetie! this is very beautiful â¥ Thank you!! You are so kind You are very welcome kind sir or ma'm :) Super-game:) Thanks a lot for your gameplay! â¥</TEXT>

And the storyline and the dread were top notch. I did mess up at the end (or it was a bug, not sure), but I couldn't finish the story. And I tried twice. You can see exactly what went wrong in my video if you'd like, but other than that, I loved it and I hope to see some updates to it, and even new games from you in the future! P.S. Your game isn't listed on YT so I couldn't officially add it, but I added the link and everything in the description. :) Hi! Thank you so much for playing my game! I was really waiting for someone to record the first gameplay on YouTube! I watched your video, no, it's not your fault, it's just that the game had too long events, meaning you had to go to the second floor for the next event to work. Yesterday I uploaded a new version where I fixed it, now everything works quickly and intuitively. All the added improvements are in the description. I also added voice acting, you can rate it. I'll be glad to see you go all the way to the end! Thank you again! Oh cool, I'll definitely try and finish it then, I'm very curios to see the ending! It really is a great game. And I already rated it, but it's probably under the name "European Steve", I changed it to this yesterday. Anyway, can't wait to see more from you :) Let me know if there's anything else I can do to support! I saw that you supported my game with a donation, man, you didn't have to, but thank you so much! I'll really remember this day and you! It's very nice of you, and I was jumping for joy )) Thank you again! It was my pleasure man! No need to thank me. Indie devs pour a lot of hard work and their souls into their games and I really respect it. Thanks for the awesome experience! :) About one hour of playing this game, after I finished the box with 2 pictures. There was no more film cartridge on the table and I checked around the house trying to find anything for about 10 minutes. Nothing seemed to continue the story further. Also switching the TV quickly might crash the game. Thank you so much for playing my game! I didn't know about this bug with the TV, thank you. To progress through the game, you just need to repeat the cycle with the film: take the film from the table > print all the photos from the film > put the finished container back on the table > take a new film from the table. Thank you again, it's my pleasure! Thanks for responding. I did the cycle for about 40 minutes and suddenly after finishing one of the containers with 2 pictures there wasn't a film cartridge on the table anymore. Then I started looking around the house for a next objective for like 10 minutes. Then I got to the TV that crashed the game. As you progress through the cycle of films, text prompts will appear on the screen for a short period of time. These are events that you need to interact with. If you ignore them, the films will simply run out without any events occurring. I believe this is what happened to you. You may not have noticed any further instructions on the screen. I'll fix it and make sure the hints don't disappear if they haven't been read yet Hi! You were having trouble completing the game. I've removed the extra films that you don't need to develop, and I've simplified the events. I've uploaded a new version of the game that ensures you don't miss out on new events and on-screen prompts. Now you can quickly complete the game. Please let me know if you manage to finish the game. Thank you for playing!</TEXT>

<TITLE>ONESHOT</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game You are the only and great Robin Hood! You live in your camp. You get raided by Roman Empire. You must defend yer land. But behold! You have only one arrow! And you need nothing more, your shoot-then-retrieve-it journey begins! Trailers: Game made for the global game jam 2021 by: Modestas Daugvydas Mantas Eduard Inga Giedrius Eugenijus Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. yo get this game to 1 million plays guys nice game concept. i hope there are ways to wield other weapons like sword as option to fight the enemies. the game kind a lags a bit but seems fun anyway. cant wait for full game great game, a little choppy and buggy but would love to see this in the future. Starts at 5:49. Was a great little game and a really fun concept! It definitely needs work in a lot of aspects, but at the core, it is really fun to play and has great visuals! The game was super vibrant and really felt fresh and really had a breath taking environment! Even the subtle and soft background noises enhanced the whole game's feel. (Video below is anyone wants to watch!) That being said, I felt like the core mechanic of the game could be improved. One way is by adding more arrows around the map as it's really easy to shoot one off into the distance and not able to get it back or lose it. Another suggestion is to make the aiming mechanic better, while the current way is pretty funny and adds to the game, it can be very frustrating as the player could be in the face of an enemy by completely miss due to RNG. So I think having the RNG reticle system should be used when hip firing/ not aiming and then either making the reticle smaller or just having a precise arrow where the player is aiming might be a good thing as it promotes skill and also makes the player feel less frustrated and more in control of their character and the way they shoot! Other than that, I think the game looks and feel great and is super fun to play! The glowing arrows were a great choice and that's more apparent in night time; when the arrow can be followed by it's glow. Side note; the lakes looked great with the glowy arrows in them at night! But yeah, the above were just suggestions; it's a great game so far and so good luck on future updates if you decide to work on this game some more! it's lagging in my laptop hmm, I've checked and it lags on my laptop too. We developed it on pretty beefy pcs. Not sure if we'll get back to this game to optimize it tho cool game Thank you for the video! The main time that the game lags is on startup and that's a unity thing, the only way to fix that is to add a loading screen and we should also add graphics settings, if we decide to make a full version is this for mac or windows hello, it was made and tested for windows Thank you for playing our game! It was super entertaining to watch :D But it's not even a demo, we made it during a game jam and it only took 2 days of work. So I don't think we'll be making a full version</TEXT>

NIKOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aww I wanted Prototype to finish his explanation on why sugar gets sticky. Awesome game, loved to see Niko again. wow now i remember when someone made a whole discord just for waiting for this game peak stuff :D goooooooooo this game makes me hungry Amei o jogo e as receitas me deram Ã¡gua na boca ð I have returned my loyal followers I am Mold Mario, and I approve this message YAY any chance that it'll be ported to linux? it doesnt seem to work for me using wine, had to use another computer to play it... Run it through Steam using Proton 7.0-6 What's Niko favourite colos? The conversation about measuring cups at the start really is funny to me, and I especially loved how Prototype jumped right into explaining everything. I found it amusing in this scene. When the characters shared their breakfast recipes, it added even more charm to the story. Learning about their food choices was fun, even though the idea of putting coffee in almost everything felt a bit strange to me. Playing this game even made me hungry, and I got to learn the recipe. I might try making it myself because the whole experience felt so cozy and enjoyable from start to finish. Damn, what a nice little game :) scrumptiosu Wholesome, cute AND delicious! i finally got to making them after two weeks and they are so good i agree I REQUIRE TO MAKE THOSE PANCAKES i love stupid human cat make stupid blurred pancake with giant spoiler on it :3 99% talk 1% pancakes So cute! I gotta try to make those pancakes someday! Thank you guys, this was really lovely Will this ever be added as DLC? How much does it cost to upload DLC to Steam? i will just post this from steam forum Source: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/dlc Referenced "Depot Documentation": https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots So @Topic: No it does not cost you extra $100 to release a DLC. You simply update the file-pool of your base game and create a new depot for a DLC that should be buyable. Then you link your desired DLC files with said depot and there you go It is soooooooo cool, how i didn't know about that game, i just wanna do them so much, that i want to eat and now is 0:30, best game i ever played 10 pancakes / 10, so much smiling and i won't regret my decision to not go to sleep HOW HAS IT BEEN 10 YEARS ALREADY?! time flies when oneshot I will be playing this later. Thank you, Future Cat Games & Nightmargin. I know a bit of Japanese, but not a lot, but maybe I could make a Translation patch? masterpeice 10 years?!!, how passing the timeâ¦ Iâm remember when Iâas played this game in 2014 I made Polish translations for OneShot and OneShot the Pancake Episode! Happy 10th Anniversary! Where are they? My game does not start, a window just appears for a second and then disappears. I had the same error with the main game, but there I simply changed it to the 32-bit version. Exactly as advertised, nobody died and Niko got pancakes pot***ium Cesium better. Happy birthday! sorry niko im kinda late, but happy birthday Happy Late Ass 10th Anniversary! (I Said Late Ass Because I'm Late By 34 Days.) cool, tho idk where i could find a spanish localization,,</TEXT>

If you moved it enough then the direction indication will appear (I don't know if is what you were trying). I agree I could have explained it better ^^'.

<TEXT>OneShot is a retro inspired arcade game where you (literally) only have one shot. Don't forget to post your highscore in the comments! Fullscreen is highly recommended. Made in 48 hours. Music by FrequentlyAskedMusic Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. hold on this aint oneshot its a oneshot clone I wonder how many people had confused this with nightmargin's OneShot... my high score is 27 tho can i have the coding? It was made in Construct, no code :) I could send you the .capx file but I use the paid version, I don't think you would be able to open it using the free version. can I have the .capx file because i need it for my school project Why do you need to use it for your school project? Just wondering I need it for game making contest before 30 July I don't really want to give you the file if you're just going to use/copy it for your own contest submission, sorry. the roof fucks up Can you elaborate? That's the whole point of the game haha... If the player shoots without thinking about where the arrow will land then it will be harder to retrieve it. Once they learn to kill enemies while making sure the arrow lands somewhere convenient is when they'll start reaching the higher scores. Really fun to play, the graphics are great and the music is also really good. i loved the game=) Nice, I'm glad you enjoyed the game! Maybe I need to add something to stop players just jumping in the middle haha. I scored 6 two different times. This game is a great example of simplicity and minimalism. i hit a 22 ;) really fun game. I like how the player slows down when you draw back, makes shooting the enemies feel really epic. IMO the default speed of the player is too fast though, it makes it hard to control and you feel a bit frustrated when you miss the arrow. Thanks for playing and for the feedback, I'm glad you enjoyed it! I do agree with the player being a bit too fast but after messing around with different speeds it was the best compromise, any slower and it gets too hard to outrun the enemies. my top is 15 :D i have a proof edit: 7 is my current high score will keep you updated =D</TEXT>

<TITLE>OneShot: Arena</TITLE>
<TEXT>One Shot: Arena, shooter where every weapon has only one shot OS:A is a challenging fast paced shooter with very high movement speed, searching for keys and powerful weapons, however, all weapons have only one shot, before they vanish from your hands. Your goal in each level is to find the exit, be aware though, as there are a few detours filled with enemies and powerful weapons. The limited ammo often means you have to dodge bullets instead of gunning down the first thing you see. There is also a Zombie Horde mode, where you go up against infinite wave of zombies, with item dispensers spawning items every 15 seconds. The game can be played directly through a web browser However! it is highly advised to download the executable and run it on your computer, browser caps the game's framerate to 60 (instead of 240), and may cause frame timing issues if you drop below 60fps.

<TITLE>OneShot: Fading Memory</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod for Windows F a ding Memory is a fan-made mod for OneShot, with an all new story to ex p erience, new faces to meet, and brand new mechanics to exploit. You are to guide the messia h to the tower yet again, and save the world from its e ndless night as you did countless times before! However your presence is unwanted in this wor l d. Do you leave i t in peace, o r step in anyways? It's your choice, and there are conseque n ces... Some of your choices may have real, long lasting consequences. Sometimes even your best may not be enough, sometimes you just get caught off guard. And sometimes, the winning move is to not play at all. The mod has an option to play the vanilla content from within the mod. You are required to finish solstice before seeing the new modded content, however there is an optional prompt allowing you to skip right to the new content. Like OneShot, OneShot: Fading Memory is not a traditional horror game; although it leans into the horror more than OneShot, like the freeware version . It will do its best to mess with you. Official server: https://discord.gg/kSqwkj3j6Q OST: https://astrabit.bandcamp.com/album/oneshot-fading-memory-official-soundtrack INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS Download the zip and open it. Locate your OneShot path, and extract the contents of the zip into your OneShot folder. When it is finished you can run the game like normal. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I NEED MORE! IT CAN'T END HERE! when will be avaliable the following part? is this mod for the normal oneshot or the world machine edition? OneShot 2016 why my game is error? I kept seeing neko as other things. How do i fix this? Considering how much I want Niko to just live their life with their mama, I won't play this. i accidentally killed niko twice, whoops :( this may sound like a stupid question, but do you need oneshot for this to work? yes when playing the modded version of the game, at least on windows, the game closes instantly w/out any sort of prompt & doesn't save. might just be me, but I can't press the button AT ALL, and I keep forgetting. the thing is broken, it says: "Something is missing... "Where did you put my memories of Niko?" "Bring it back!" and then there is a crash saying something like: no such file or directory Data/armor.rx and some resource pack cache stuff. either one of music plays: - maxwell - maxwell reversed - maxwell remix the application name is "Oneshot - did i do something wrong?" copy files from the original game into fading memories folder So i dont know what happened but the game seems not want to open and it says:''where do you put my memories of niko bring it back'' and it close so can you please tell me what to do Yeah, I got the same error, what happened? copy the files from the original game into fading memories folder The link to the discord server seems to be broken.

<TITLE>OneShot ModLoader</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool for Windows OneShot ModLoader is an open-source mod loader for OneShot. To begin, you'll first need to E nsure that you have a fresh install of OneShot with no mods. If you're absolutely certain you've never modified the game files, you can skip this step. Fresh Install: Steam: --Right click on OneShot in your steam library, click on P roperties > Local Files and click Browse. --Select everything and delete it. --Now just uninstall OneShot and reinstall it and you should be ready to roll! (It's not recommended to just verify the integrity of the game files once you delete everything, so reinstall it instead.) Itch.io : --The same process, just delete everything and reinstall it. Setup Instructions: --Now that you have a fresh install of One S hot, click the Setup button and paste the path to your OneShot installation. Installing Mods: --Drop the mod(s) you want to install into the Mods folder. --Click the Mods button, highlight your mod(s) in the I nactive Mods list and click Add to List. (Mods listed higher than others will have higher priority.) --Once done, click Apply Changes and wait. --All done! Just run OneShot. How about when I want to uninstall my mod? --Just remove your mod from the Active Mods list and click Apply Changes again. FAQ: Q: Will there be a L inux or MacOS port? A: It's very likely that a Linux port will happen, but not as much a Mac port. If you want to give a Mac port a spin though it's totally open source: https://github.com/callistoAshley/osmodloader Q: Help, I found a bug! What do I d O ? A: Contact me! I can be reached via email at callistoashley (at) proton (dot) me Alternatively, you could ask around in # world-machine in the OneShot Discord Server or in the ModShot Discord Server (the former of which I am not currently in) for someone to help, the invites to which you can find here: OneShot Server: https://discord.gg/OneShot ModShot Server: https://discord.gg/YRd8xMmde3 Q: Huh, the main menu looks kinda empty... A: I'm glad you noticed! There's some talk of adding a page for browsing mods on a repo, similar to TModLoader's mod browser. There's no guarantee that this will happen, but it's very possible.

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows THIS IS A FAN PROJECT WITH NO RELATION TO THE ORIGINAL ONESHOT IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE ORIGINAL YOU REALLY SHOULD https://futurecat.itch.io/oneshot A fan made remake of Oneshot in 3D!... .. .About three years behind schedule ===HOW TO PLAY=== WASD to move around, Mouse to look, Space to interact, I to open inventory, Tab to quickly switch items, F11 to enter/exit fullscreen Right now, the opening house is completely built save for one cutscene, and there will be more in the future! ===CREDITS=== Original Oneshot Team - Concept, location, original game Bluebstopcat - Art, Programming, Level Design Wintermelon - Music Zapsplat.com - Sound Effects Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. the game window is bigger than my screen, and i cant fix it lol very good game, even though it`s a demo i loved it. hi [khello sometime when i pick up the sun, it would be just appering and dessapiring from time to time, thats probally a glitch there yeah it gliches for me too. the developer shoudl really fix their gvame I think I found some bugs. The computer screen is off-center, the continue button is pretty small, the Tab menu is pretty close together which makes it hard to pick items, the lightbulb disappears when I walk, and the spacebar sometimes doesn't continue the prompt. I think the first three might just be because I'm using a low resolution though. I also have some suggestions, I wish there was a pause menu and I feel like controlling the camera could be better. Maybe there could be a first-person mode or there could be a setting that adjusted the sensitivity? Aside from that, this is pretty good and I can't wait to see what comes out from it! yeah yeah When I saw this game,I was just listening to the music On Little Cat Feet. This is awesome! Even though it is just the house it was pretty amazing. There are some stuff that definitely could be improved but this is a really good start. Thank you! And yeah, this is pretty much a fresh start for the project. I was at a really different skill level when I started versus now, so I've been fixing the mistakes I previously made, and have mostly future-proofed it. Now I just need to use the tools I've made to make more. Bugs I've encountered in my playthrough: With the remote, two of the same number can be missing. In my playthrough I had both a Red 2 and a Green 2 You can interact with the bed and the computer at the same exact time. After the PC cutscene, Niko holds the Sun for a brief moment. After closing the inventory, your mouse cursor will be visible until you click again. If you interact with the door to the outside and then see the lightbulb cutscene, it shows the lightbulb slot the entire time. Niko sometimes just doesn't hold the sun during their walk cycle Options do not save whenever you reload the game, leading to potential ear murdering by the music Thank you for the list of bugs! I'll get started on fixing these when I have a chance. Also I completely missed the fact that it's a remote that can't have the same button twice lmao hi lets make a game!</TEXT>

<TITLE>OneShot: Metamorphosis</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod A short, OneShot creepypasta mod, created for Halloween. Inspired by the freeware Niko sprite, this story explores what could've led to the (not a) cat conundrum, and what might've followed... Note that you DO NOT need to reset your OneShot save, nor will the mod tamper with it. However it does not save progress within the mod, as it's only 30 minutes long at most. Trying to close the game at any stage beyond the main menu at the very beginning will warn you about it. Playtime: 15-30 minutes Installation instructions: [link] Uninstallation instructions: [link] Credits: Lionmeow - Cat character/face sprites Myster - Testing Download and install OneShot (2016, not Freeware) Download and extract the mod files into the OneShot directory, overriding existing files. Note that you DO NOT need to reset your OneShot save, nor will the mod tamper with it. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Saddest mod go fuck yourself Definitely has Treehouse of Horror vibes. 9/10. Not only is this an interesting mod for oneshot, which will allow you to play our favorite game once again, but it's also a creepypasta. Not the usual "Niko.exe" type, but really something unusual and in the manner of the original game. i am going to make niko.exe real i can't figure out how to install this mod edit: nevermind. got it hey that's a pretty cool mod its actually good like fr its pretty good and like well written and stuff dont stop playing when you're like halfway through the game and are bored for reasons i wont spoil the payoff is huuge pretty cool.</TEXT>

Or maybe simply a way to check up on niko to see what they are doing.. if that makes sense? maybe another season, Halloween or... something else, Nikos birthday? anything tbh, Cant wait to hear your ideas! this was really nice but how can i delete the gift? i ran it on boot once and i cant seem to delete it now Go to `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`, and delete it from there thanks so much finally managed to disable it also keep in mind that this fan game is wonderful and awesome. Thanks for all the effort :D! I cried i loved this it needs more love <3 has "_______.exe" any differences from the original one? because if it isn't (not able to check what's in gift.zip to verify that works), this would likely work for mac as well It had to be recompiled for a changed graphic aah, I understand >~< is there a way for me to recompile it myself, or does that rely on assets and things you haven't released? It's in the OneShot repository: https://github.com/elizagamedev/mkxp-oneshot The graphic change is very simple, shouldn't be hard to recreate. But it's also not a big deal, because you won't be missing THAT much, and it's not worth the headache in my opinion. might be interesting for me to see if I can figure out how to make it work, but regardless, thank you so much for your responses! I'll see about trying out the mod soon. If I understand correctly and the macOS journal works the same as the Linux one, all the journal graphics should be stored in the 'images' directory of OneShot's folder. Not sure what or where the changed graphic is but would simply replacing it there work? Thank you for making a mod for this amazing game Very nice mod!! Made me tear up as much as the original game! good mod â¤ heart was shattered by oneshot the first time a year and a half ago heart is now completely fixed by this mod, thank you so much Will there be a spanish version? If someone makes it Ig i can, mas o menos puedo hablarlo asi que podria ser, never changed anything on oneshot's files but probably aÃ±aÃ±aÃ±aÃ±aÃ±aÃ±aÃ±Ã±aÃ±aÃ±a de repente ayudo porque yo si hablo bien espaÃ±ol ;) Is it plot-wise how we found this mod? Otherwise, I can't understand why TWM gave us the opportunity to meet Niko again, since it is not safe. Or I didn't understand? Plot-wise, you did something that brought Niko back into that world. What that something is, is up for interpretation. Haven't even left the barrens yet and this has already cured my post-solstice depression. Thank you therapist zimberzimber. ABSOLUTE CINEMA! The effort put into this mod is crazy.. I loved this mod so much, good work! My question is, does the game talk about the "next meeting", does that mean there will be a sequel Is this avalible for World Machine Edition? (I have a switch and I don't want to pay another 15 bucks on steam just to install this mod.) Unfortunately not, as WME has a completely different engine. filled a niko-shaped hole in my heart. just... thank you so MUCH for creating this mod! Ð¡Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð±Ð¾ ÑÐµÐ±Ðµ, ÑÑÐ¾ Ð´Ð°Ð» ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾ ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð° Ð²ÑÑÑÐµÑÐ¸ÑÑ ÑÐ²Ð¾Ð¸Ñ Ð´ÑÑÐ·ÐµÐ¹, ÑÑ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾ Ð»ÑÑÑÐ¸Ð¹. Thank you, just thank you Mod is great. Can't believe there is Chinese. èä¸éç¿»è­¯å¾å¾ä¸é¯…… This mod made me nostalgic for the game again. I really like the small details and thanks for the Russian translation :3 Absolute masterpiece. First time that I've teared since the original game. I hope more people will notice this mod. Holy shit, this is the best mod i have ever played and i played every one of them. This is the BEST Oneshot mod ever! The plot is so cute and gameplay is really good, it even has a new mechanics, for example, snowball fight. The only notation about Russian translation: it sometimes looks very strange, usually there are mistakes with pronouns, but there are strange phrases too. This mod is fucking amazing. I want more. This mod is a masterpiece. On the level of the original, unequivocally. This is exactly the epilogue I wanted so badly when I did my first playthrough of OneShot. Thank you for bringing me back to Niko and to this world (and thank you for the added Russian language, I was very pleasantly surprised by it!).</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable mod Niko has been gone for a long time. Without the Messiah, thereâs no one left to carry a new story. All that remains are memories. You can rewind them all you want, but nothing ever changes. ...but... What if I told you I know a way? A way to get more out of The World Machine. A way to reach beyond the memories of the original subject of this simulation. ...and be given a chance to help someone else. Don't worry, you have no reason to hesitate. Everything will be simulated. No living people will be put in harm's way. If you're interested... I have everything you need, right here, waiting for you to take it. Do you accept? Links: Official Discord Server Twitter Account YouTube Account Soundtrack on SoundCloud Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. can someone help? i just started playing the mod and it says that there is a missing graphic called pc4. thanks. I have just released a patch that fixes this. Thank you! oh i had to because it wouldnât let me log in to my old account for some reason.. will the composer ever release it themselves? or will it not be available in any way or included on the ost? just wondering how it all works… (oops it posted my comment twice sorry) I canât speak for the composer, thatâs up to them. Also is there any reason you made a new account for this comment? hi. An anonymous person here. I would sincerely appreciate if you could tell me what happened to the music from the title screen? The opening screen with âthe tarion machineâ the music used to be on the YouTube playlist but seems to have been replaced with âgood golly goshâ I forgot the name of it but it was my favorite song and Iâm wondering if it was deleted or privated? If so why? Would there be any chance of bringing it back? âgood golly goshâ is unrelated, itâs for something else. What happened was that I got called out for not requesting proper permission to upload the track to the OST (which I accept full responsibility for, I remembered the conversation I had with the composer incorrectly.) so I took it down from both YouTube and SoundCloud, and it wonât be reuploaded unless I get direct permission to do so, which is unlikely. TL;DR: Didnât ask for permission to upload it, took it down, probably not coming back.</TEXT>

Game is a bit glitchy so I didn't implement the lose mechanic (you should lose if you miss even one shot) Made in a few (<4!) hours for One Hour Game Jam Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Nice game! The graphics are excellent. The GUI also looks good! Even though the bouncing mechanic isn't used (You always get the ball back regardless the timing), the basic idea is decent enough. Just a few things to feedback: Anyway I enjoyed playing it :D Haha thanks for playing! This is all great feedback. I'm pretty pleased with what I achieved in this timeframe because this is a NES rom written in 6502 assembly. You could download this and play it on a real 1986 NES... and assembly is generally a lot slower to write than a higher level language. But I *want* to be able to do it faster, which is one reason I've resumed onehourgamejam entries. Ah I see. Then it is pretty impressive if this written in assembly Promising! - and admirable goal (MC).</TEXT>

<TITLE>DEAD MOON: A ONESHOT FOR LIMINAL HORROR$4In bundle</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Dead Moon is a Oneshot for LIMINAL HORROR that is spiritually inspired by Silent Hill 2. Its OCT. 31. 2003. You awaken behind the wheel of a crashed car. Your head is pounding. The moon shines a blood-red hue, tainting the landscape in its crimson light. The town seems abandoned. You can't remember who you are, but you find a note and a photograph in your pocket—a photo of a woman. The site of her face ties your stomach in knots. You must save her. The town seems abandoned, as you and your companions head into town on foot... Find Her. Find a car. Find the truth. CW: Body-horror. Violence. Disturbing themes. Death. Murder. Dead Moon is an independent production by DNGN CLUB GAMES and is not affiliated with Goblin Archives LLC. It is published under the Liminal Horror Third Party License.

I found some grammar errors in the pdf. Would you still be open to modifying it or is this the final version lay it on me and ill fix it! Cool, well here's what I found. I'm an English teacher and proofread as a side thing, so sorry for the long list lol. 1. "1d4 Monsters Attacks" on page 3 should maybe be Monsters Attack. 2. "May take 1 stress damage" should maybe be more forward, like will take. 3. "If you successfully complete a random encounter gain a" appears twice. 4. "a oversized maggot" should be an oversized maggot. 5. "six pale arm" should be six pale arms. 6. "charred corpses and corridors moan" implies that the corridors, aka the building, are also moaning. Maybe not an error. 7. "if the players read the files" should start with a capital I. 8. "The center of the junkyard" text mentions the junkyard twice. Not an error per se, but it is a bit redundant. 9. "drunken and belligerent" could be changed to drunk and belligerent for consistency. 10. "who is she to you?" should start with a capital W. 11. If all the players need to fail their save for the car to be destroyed, maybe changing it to "have the players make a CTRL save" would be more appropriate. Since the odds of everyone failing their save, one at a time, are extremely low. 12. "when you encounter any non-monster NPC" should start with a capital W. "(including HER)" should end with a period. 13. Only one of the reaction roll results has a period. 14. both "cut your hand with the blade" and "insert in a VHS player" should start capitalized for consistency. 15. "allows your to transfer" should start with a capital A, and your should be you. 16. "you see the town for its what it really is" should have its removed. 17. "Shards of razor" should maybe be changed to Razor shards or even just Razors. 18. "this town returns to a normalcy" should maybe be changed to the town returns to normalcy. Or just normal. 19. The BLOODBAG stat block is missing a CTRL value. Unless this is as intended. 20. "MONSTEROUS LOCAL" should be MONSTROUS LOCAL. 21. "They steal something useful to the party" should maybe be changed to from the party. 22. "into dog-like proportions" is missing a period at the end. 23. "they are unable to accept." should maybe be more final, like unable to accept it or they can't accept (removing the comma before). 24. "maybe you die before you have the chance" should maybe be, maybe you'll die. Or you will die. 25. "is the carrot to keep delving" just sounds quite odd. "but not the point" also makes that sentence quite odd. 26. "This is game about" should be is a game. 27. "Add more monsters if you like" should maybe be if you'd like or if you want. you're amazing! thank you so much! All updated! Thank you so much for your time and energy, I included a shout out to you in the PDF! Happy to have been helpful. I ran the one shot a few days ago and my players had a blast. One of them even became the new sheriff after beating the old one at a game of knucklebones. All this to say, keep up the good work! on the random table it says, monster attacks, are there statblocks for,or? You can use one of the monsters in the adventure orany monster from liminal horror, or make one up! Nice the about LH is how simple the stats are! Yes, i started watching live play from this one, so...coming from other systems. Really digging LH and this kind of stuff. Thanks. its a great system, made by some really cool people! Looking forward to reading this one! Very cool design layout!!!! Thank you so much! Love this set up and the lost memories. Big Silent Hill meets Memento vibes was my first thought. Beautiful layout as well...as always. Thank you matt! I appreciate you, as always! sounds to me more like a mix of sh1, sh2, shattered memories and p.t.! while being its own thing, great work, i love the visuals! Thank you! Yeah, I'm drawing more from the franchise as a whole!</TEXT>

<TITLE>UnderShot (UnderTale X OneShot mod)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod WARNING : Game includes only the 3 MAIN routes. As such, any neutral subending other than LV 0 with no exp will crash the game. Yes, all 3 main routes. Even that one. ANOTHER WARNING: Probably obvious, but please make sure you have finished Undertale and Oneshot's solstice run before playing this mod YET ANOTHER WARNING: Don't load save files from the normal Undertale game in Undershot YET YET ANOTHER WARNING: The mod assumes some things which weren't confirmed as canon in Oneshot. For example, this mod assumes Niko's species's name is the same as ours A mod which completely erases Frisk and switches them out with Niko. Takes place right after the solstice run of Oneshot. After the events of Oneshot's Solstice run, Niko looks forward to hugging their mama again, and getting pancakes(and maybe also expects a scolding for being gone for so long). They say their goodbyes to the player in an emotional moment, and pass through the portal back home, expecting to be back at the wheat fields soon... ...and then they find themselves falling down a several hundred feet deep crater elsewhere in player's machine. Boy, this was just not their day... [Features] Walk with the innovative WASD keys! Better dust animation [CREDITS] now!! go get it!!! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. So... 10th Anniversary is out, and Toby has made all the content from the charity stream available to the public. What are the odds we might see an update to Undershot for the 10th Anni. content? Admittedly, it would be pretty funny to see Niko's reaction to Sans's boss "fight" on the Pacifist route, Mad Mew Mew, and Hotland High. good mod!!!! (source: real Nikodev) yeahhhh thats how you know its good how do i spare papyrus without hurting niko what lock tf in. why does my pc detect a trojan on the download called Trojan:Win32/Sabsik.FL.A!ml also why are there corrupt files in the zip i cant even extract the delta patcher not sure why that happened with the latest patch but i tried uploading a fix. if it still doesn't work try downloading it off of gamejolt instead got it, had to do a workaround by getting the talent show edition and using the patcher off of that because its not corrupted for some reason(?) trojans probably a nothingburger, i heard that the "ml" at the end of the name could signify a false positive as its just windows defender using machine learning to automatically identify threats that arent actually reported on any databases i see. tried making another fix based on this information hope you enjoy the mod It's a false positive from your firewall. For whatever reason, it thinks the Delta Patcher is a high level threat and deletes it along with the rest of the mod. Less than 24 hours since the mod was released and I've already cleared it on True Pacifist. This was a blast to play, watching Niko's responses to the characters and situations, and how we-the player-actually have a much bigger role in this compared to the normal version. Also, the fact that Niko interacts so much in this game gives me incentive to never do the genocide route. I refuse to hurt this precious cat-person. Alas, it's not a perfect mod. Some of the dialogue from one of the enemies is borked. I can't remember which one, but I think it was a Waterfall or Hotland encounter. The text for one of their ACTs will suddenly shrink and stay that way until the start of next turn. One of Asriel's lines when you're talking to him in the Ruins is botched as well. Specifically, "Niko... You and [PLAYER] really ARE different from Chara." hello! I'm really glad you enjoyed the mod, it means a lot I can't seem to find the borked dialogue you mentioned, and I didn't see it happen to anyone I saw play the game, so it might be something really specific? Either way, I fixed the asriel's text bug you mentioned. thanks for the report Heck yeah! Can't wait to hang out with Niko again! I'm hoping it'll get finished, It really looks awesome! its out This looks awesome, can't wait to play whenever it comes out! its out now</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable game A complete one-shot adventure for both Shadowdark and EZD6 TTRPG systems that sees players exploring an abandoned mine that uncovers a sprawling underground tunnel system filled with goblins and an ancient colony of crystalline arachnids. Great care has been taken to make this supplement one that's helpful at the table. Each location's section is self-contained, with relevant creature stats and tables right where you need them and evocative, easy-to-understand language that seeks to make the game master's job as easy as possible. Includes: In order to download this game you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $5 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Solid low level adventure. Readability was 10/10, and was super usable at the table. Two players died but they had a great time and decided to go down swinging to cover their party against the big bad. The adventure has a take on goblins you don't see super often. Maps were cute, and the room generator isn't a system I've seen before. There's a lot of replay value here as a GM. Magic items are nice and Ii just printed the handouts to use in my campaign in the future. 10/10 random tables. Yoinked for my gameworld for sure. I'm so glad you had a good run!</TEXT>

<TITLE>[Project: OXALIS]</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable mod [Project: OXALIS] is a fan continuation to the world of the surreal Puzzle/Adventure game âOneShotâ. Few years after the events of Solstice, you and Niko find yourselves returning to this world. There will be consequences. Do you wish to proceed? ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ Along with a complete engine overhaul powered by mkxp-z, the game boasts optimization and a graphical upgrade, accompanied by an original atmospheric soundtrack. Upon this, the game also includes: This is a continuation to the original game, which can be found and purchased on Steam , or here on itch.io . This game comes with its own interpretation of the world of OneShot and its characters, meaning that not all content, be that visuals or lore, will be unanimously agreed upon. This is also the same project formerly titled " OneShot: Aftermath" . With that said, much like OneShot, [OXALIS] contains aspects of paranoia and heart-string pulling. [OXALIS] also contains mild language from some residents, none of which is excessive however. "Please proceed with caution." - [DATA_CORRUPTED] Only an English translation has been added to the game currently, however, there are more planned to be added, and a respective update for said languages will be released when possible. At the time of release, we have no plans on picking up the project again. You can read about the details here , but long story short, due to a multitude of issues surrounding the development of the game as well as our personal lives, we will be taking a break from the project until further notice. While we wouldn't consider this a proper "cancellation", and hope we will find the passion in the future, that possibility is distant, the project will still be marked as such here. We apologize, but hope you enjoy what you see here. Additionally! This Mod requires a copy of Oneshot to be played. You must drag the contents of the "Snapshot" Folder into your Oneshot install. It will not launch otherwise. The latest build has been patched to avoid frequent crashes, but it's not intended to be playable. Instead it is meant to be opened and explored with RPG maker. Lastly, "oxalis.bundle" is a git history bundle. You can read up on what that means here . We encourage fans to do they please with what we have released here, but do know that not everything is included, especially certain story beats, for the hope of an eventual return to the game. Enjoy!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Escape from the Horde</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable module Escape from the Horde is a short, lethal oneshot module, with rules included. The characters begin in the deepest room of a gnomish warren, stripped of their weapons, and about to be eaten by the goblins who have overrun the area. They must figure out the layout, work the gnomish contraptions and traps to move upwards, and see which allies they can make along the way. The dungeon includes a dragon (who is too large to fit through the door to the treasure room), several unpredictable magic scrolls (each activated by answering a riddle), and various cells with other prisoners (where the group can find new characters to replace any who died already). You see two doors ahead. The first is labelled 'oneshot', and promises a short session, and introduces rules throughout the module, as they become relevant. The other door contains a larger warren, with more challenges, but less help learning the rules. The handouts contain - a brief summary of the rules for reference, - farmer statblocks to cut out and give to players so they can start a prisoner's revolt, - and lots of pre-generated characters. The game is lethal, so players will need to use the spare characters before long. The module explains the rules as it goes, but also contains page-number references to the Core Rules , so you can reference the complete rulebook if you want a more visceral system. Fun fact of the day: PDF stands for 'Printable Document Format'. Every part of this module has been designed for the printed page, so whichever PDF you select, remember to print it.</TEXT>

<TITLE>One Shot World</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game What Is This? One Shot World is a hack of Dungeon World that removes most of the long-form mechanics and replaces them with simple rules designed to facilitate one-shots and short campaigns. What's Changed? Included are the core rules, playkit & playbooks, starters and supplements intended to make your one shots shine! This game is (and always will be) FREE OF CHARGE. Cover art: Greg Soper Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hi, I already DM 3 sessions with your system, and it works amazing for One-shots. My party loved it, how easy and fluid the char creation and XP systems works. Congratulations! I was looking for a Immolator's Playbook (a class from OG DW), did you ever do it, or someone else? I will keep OSW as my to go for one shots! No, I hated that playbook! Hahaha isn't my char choice neither, but one of my players love it! Thanks for replying! Just finished running this for a couple of friends and it was very well received! We all had a lot of fun. It was my first time running anything Powered by the Apocalypse and I think we'll be coming back to the system again after this marvellous introduction Got to introduce a new player to RPGs last night using One Shot World. Totally fun! This hack of Dungeon World lives up to its promise of optimizing the game for one shots and making character/setting creation quick and enjoyable. Started our session with a mid-battle cold open, and the Barbarian dispatched the giant snake enemy with one hit—but that was great, as we got to then see the PCs poke around the creature's cave, interrogate a corpse with Cleric magic, and generally get into shenanigans until the mountain itself started trying to eat them. A good time was had by all. Thank you for making this excellent hack available! I have been using it for the last year to introduce people to role-playing games, or transition from D&D into other fiction-first style systems. To that end, I took the liberty of converting the playbooks to be form-fillable for remote play online. If you have the time and inclination, please have a look and consider adding them to the "Downloads" section for everyone. :D Form Fillable OSW Playbooks Thank you SO much! I will upload them with credit. One of my all time favorite things to print and hand out to IRL nerds when they start asking me about DIY d&d. I have given this away many times. I love this thing you made. Hi, great job, I'd really like to make a French translation of the game if it's ok with you? Do you have by any chance a plaintext version of the game to make the work easier? Hello! You are welcome to make a translation. I don't have a plaintext version but I'm happy to share the individual files (I made it in Google Draw). You can copy the text from each page. Even better... Now i will be able to easily stick to the original layout :) Hi, I wonder... Why are some pages on the drive not present in the final pdf ? For example "Players Moves" ? I think I ended up cutting them. I don't remember, it was a long time ago! Hello, did you make it to the end and is it available somewhere? This looks very good. OSW Print Instructions.pdf refers to a cheat sheet.Where can I find that? does this help? https://drive.google.com/file/d/13idlGIOIKphIsivCLoBbn87cczIqgP0G/view?usp=drivesdk Hi Yochai! That like points to the printing instructions linked right above these comments (for me). In it the last line mentions a âGM sheet cheat sheetâ. I donât think Iâve seen that anywhere. Ohhhh. This? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfgaq6_E0NplKWQnmK3I-uJouNq1akOQ/view?usp=drivesdk That will be very useful. Thank you! This is a great fantasy PbtA, the rules are generally light yet every PCs can still have distinct uniqueness among each other. It's easy to understand and GM as well. Thank you so much for making this game available to all of us, Yochai. If you guys are looking for easy to run, fantasy PbtA suitable for short campaigns, One Shot World should be your go to. I highly recommend this game. Thank you much! May I also suggest Homebrew World by Jeremy Strandberg? It was a sort of reaction to OSW and I really love it. I will surely check Homebrew World too Yochai. Thank you for the advice! Apparently Mr. Jeremy Strandberg kindly provides Homebrew World for free too. Good luck on all your projects too, Yochai. Best regards. I love this game - thank you for bringing it into the world. It was the perfect thing for my group when our regular DM couldn't make it one day. Question on the Wizard / Antiquarian background: " When you Cast a Spell , prepare one additional spell from your spellbook" sounds like you'll get to prepare every spell in your book during a day of adventuring - is that the intent, or have I misunderstood? That is definitely a typo! It should say "When you prepare a spell..." Thanks so much!</TEXT>

<TITLE>One Shot</TITLE>
<TEXT>This game was made for BlackThornProd 2021 game jam #3. The theme was Less Is More, my game fits the theme by the player having to pick back up bullets that were once shot by the player or enemies. The more bullets your player is carrying the slower your character moves. This was a solo project so thank you for playing! If the Web version is not working for you check out the downloadable one down below. There is a downloadable file. Click the download button, find the OneShot,zip file right click and extract files. Run the OneShot.exe! Have fun! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Very addicting, few things of note though. It'd be really cool if the layout of the map was randomized each time you reset, and since the enemies can lock onto you through walls it means that you can cheese them by sitting on the other side, waiting for them to shoot and then coming around. Lastly the game is a lot more fun when you're moving super fast so my recommendation would be to increase the speed of the player at all levels. Overall though it's an extremely fun game that is really hard to put down. Thank you for the feedback! I'll have to work on the randomize level design, I think that's a really good idea! I'm always trying to improve the AI so I will look into better movement for them. this is very nice :0 Thank you! I was thinking about adding multiplayer to it! Like 4 player free for all couch style! that would be awesome! very cool game. i really love dodging bullets to grab ammo. a feedback and rating on my game wiuld be great Rate cubic sword game by EM GameDev for Blackthornprod GAME JAM #3 - itch.io Thank you!

The cave tiles are not in the package. can import this to pico 8 directly? sorry if its a silly question. New to pico. cant find any platformer tiles. was hopeful at first, but now kinda disappointed You should add the license into metadata for the asset pack(s): "Edit asset pack->Metadata->Release Info->License for assets" It will increase the size of audience that will be able to find your art I am unable to find the cave wall textures used in the preview image here within the zip file. Are they part of the pack too? Nice. Would you mind setting the âAsset licenseâ field in the âMore informationâ box, or adding a link to the page on the Creative Commons site? There are multiple versions of the CC BY-SA license and that introduces a bit of ambiguity into what you mean. i love how those bricks looks thank you so much! nice, i might use this Thanks, what program did you do you? Donated and got it. Epic Assets dude! Im using this in Godot Engine, can i distribute it? I will give u full credits. :) Nice work btw yep you're free to distribute it! Thank you! I will give u a small amount of donation soon :) Using parts of it for my prototype over here … Goork the game Inspired me when i started out to draw my own ingame alot also ;) I also donated you some Money ;) thank you so much, i'm so glad i could inspire you! What is the appropriate attribution, if needed? Thanks! The name "Kicked-in-Teeth" is preferred in your credits, however the name "George Fisher" can also be used! Thanks!

<TITLE>Free PICO-8 Pixelart Tiles</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Hello Folks! Here you got some FREE 8x8 pixelart tiles for some simple games, or dev mockups. Feel free to use them. But it would be highly appreciated if you mention me in projects / prototypes and post your project that uses the graphics in the comments here :) This tiles are free and you don't have to pay anything. You can donate, if you want me to do some more. You can also use these tiles in commercial projects, but again: It would be appreciated if you mention me. Feel free to comment and give Feedback. I hope you enjoy! While I think tech & "real" AI would have been a great benefit for humanity (for example: medical, educational, e.g.) Most corporations decided to go a different direction. Generative AI has stolen work from artists all around the world. By using any gen. AI you support the -probably biggest- art theft in history. None of the artists got paid or even asked. With this badge I express that my art is free from any kind of AI. I do not use it for my art or generating references or ideas. You can get the badges for free here: No AI Badges on Itch and read more about it. Support artists. Also all my assets come with a license that allows them to be used inside commercial work as long as they are not used with, within AI or uploaded to any AI. Support You can get support here on itch.io or via Twitter. I usually respond within 24h :) This is not my first assetpack and over the last years in gamedev I pretty much understand how to build a good tileset. You can check out my other stuff too! Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hi, I wanted to thank you for these cute assets! Iâve created my first prototype for a game jam using it. If you want to try it hereâs the link: https://themagiulio.itch.io/nala . Hope you like it! Neat little game. It's actually what I had in mind, when creating these assets. if you want to make it into a full game, hit me up for the assets :) Thanks! Sure, you can find me on discord as themagiulio. that music is fantastic too, where is it from? It is! Itâs called Tranquility, the author is called Onys. I found it on free music archive . We have sent you a donation, we will use it for a videogame, thank you very much. I have to thank you :) feel free to share the link to your game once you got something to play! :) thanks! Yeahh!!! ;) This is the game ð https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pcnonogames.thetreasurecavefre... Hey, I tried the link and it doesn't work. It's 3y old. Probably not available anymore. @pcnonogames you got an upload on itch? Yes. You can to see in my itch page. ð https://pcnonogames.itch.io/the-treasure-cave-android-by-pcnonogames looks like celeste pico edition :) thanks :) it's a wonderfull game. one my top 10! I discovered this thanks to the BLM bundle a while back and have just gotten around to checking out the tileset. I immediately fell in love with it and have actually edited most of the set to work with GB Studio. As of right now, I only have a map you can walk around in, but I'm still trying to figure out what kind of game I should make with it, to be perfectly honest. If you have any questions or concerns or just want to see what I have, I can send you a screenshot or short proof of concept video, if you'd like. Thanks for these beautiful assets! -kris Hey Sam I loved this so much I ended up using almost this entire set lol. It's awesome! Your other stuff looks really great too I like the aesthetic. I wish I could come up with more ideas! I used this for my short interactive narrative here . Just wanted to say thanks. thank you :) and you're welcome. Eager to try your project! Howdy. Love the style, so I borrowed it for my current prototype. I've modified your assets to include animation and such for the game. Does your current license actually prevent that (no derivatives). I'll probably end up picking up your mega-pack if I continue down this route, and don't want to box myself in. I can drop your assets at this stage if I can't modify :( Check out the game here: https://searle.itch.io/numbers Hey Searle, Thanks for your message and for using my assets! As long as: Do not worry at all. Credits is always highly appreciated (thank you!). If someone wants to make money on a professional level with their project and wants to use modified parts of my assets, just get in contact with me . I would love to make (more) art for the game, or we can get along with some agreement. In the end, I make a living from doing graphics - keeping in contact with the community and trying to get the best out of everyones games is keeping me alive. Be sure that I would never lawsuit indiegame-devs making free or "low-income" indie games. You are welcome to use the assets and modify it. This applies to all of my assets I published on itch.io as long as the points above are true. I hope that clarifies my choice of the license and you can use it in your projects as you want. Best regards, Sam Thanks for making that clear. I was considering this as part of a pile of possible resources for experimenting with game development but, while I respect your position, if I make a free game, my ultimate aspiration would be to see it beside things like OpenTTD in the Debian Linux package repositories, and all major definitions of open-source include a clause which Debian phrases as "No discrimination against fields of endeavor, like commercial use.". Also, I have to say: I love how you use the assets, looks really nice with that UI! And the music is lovely too! Keep up the good work :) Thanks, Sam. That really means a lot. If you're interested in discussing collaboration, I'd be up for it. Producing the art assets is fun, but not my strong suit. Feel free to touch base with me in Discord. Discord ID: Searle#0215 I love your art! Thanks. Thank you so much! :) If you like leave a comment on what free ressources are missing on itch.io, maybe when I got some time I can do some more ;) Iâm a big fan of your assets. The metroid-like stuff is great! Keep âem coming. Itâs really good stuff. These are perfect time saver for many prototypes and projects indeed. Thank you. Thank you so much! :) those responses keep me going. I will do more! What kind of assets are needed often? Maybe there is something missing and I can fill the gap ;) Iâm a sucker for metroid stuff... I canât help it :D Haha me too.

<TITLE>Pico-8 Oracles$2</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack This 8x8 tileset is made for Zelda-like Pico-8 games but you can use it in any way you want. It includes enough tiles and sprites to make a varied environment but you will have to add some more tiles of your own if you want to make a full game. Most tiles in the sheet are included in the screenshots but here is a list of things: If used in Pico-8 there is not a lot of empty space left in the tileset so you can remove some tiles that you dont need, or use sprite manipulation to reduce it even more. If you decide to use some of my tiles in your game then credits are appreciated :) In order to download this asset pack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $2 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. well this is amazing! Glad you like it! Really nice! love to see more from you! Thank you very much :)</TEXT>

The compiler should allow you to edit your graphics, sounds and maps separately, but it's not two-way and always keep a backup!!! Just let it run while you edit the files. If the p8 file doesn't generate at first, try saving a .lua file in the designated folder. You should get a confirmation that a file changed in the terminal log. https://github.com/ambocclusion/pico-8-compiler Click download now to get access to the following files:</TEXT>

For details on these fonts and hints on how to use them in editors, see the Github site: https://github.com/juanitogan/p8-programming-fonts Thus far, only one TrueType font (DejaVu) and a few Windows FON bitmap fonts are available here. I could convert the bitmap fonts to Unix/Linux types, but is that really needed anymore considering FreeType now supports FON as well?

Thank you! A fine idea, I'm sure. The collection just grew somewhat unpredictably from one to many the more I got distracted by the challenge of editing various fonts. Thus, packaging them is something I never cared to go back and do after the challenge wore off. Maybe if they got more interest. The collection makes a bit more sense on the GitHub page where it's maybe easier to find the ones you want. As far as I can tell so far, most people download only one or two. Or... follow the GitHub link above and download a zip of the repo. UPDATE: Added a download button to the top of the list that links to the repo's master.zip (non-PICO-8 Tektite not included).</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Maze Algorithm Tutorial</TITLE>
<TEXT>Z - move to the next step X - switch on/off auto or reset the maze. Below is a heavily-commented implementation of the actual algorithm used in the tutorial above. It's called the Growing Tree Maze Algorithm if you'd like to learn more about it. Note: If you'd like to implement this code, you need to draw a wall in sprite #001 and a floor in sprite #002. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Very cool algorithm, I really like the implementation here. Nice work! I kept wondering where you decided what piece to choose(a straight, crossing, etc), i even coded it myself to figure it out. And then, when i looked at it again, it hit me. You don't! They just exist because they are not walls! I kept trying to guess which piece goes where :D Just what I was looking for. Thanks a lot :) This documented code is not appreciated enough. Massive thanks.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Checking for Overlap</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates one way to check for overlap between two boxes. There are many ways, but this is a simple way to do it in PICO-8. (Unlike other carts in this collection, the source code code for this cart is not intended to be used, but it just to display what you see when you run it.) Notes: This method of checking for overlap actually checks to see if the two boxes are not overlapping. The example above is simplified into using x1,y1 and x2,y2 of each box. But in practice, you would usually just have an x,y and a w,h (width and height) to work with. In that case, x1,y1 would the same as x,y and x2,y2 would be x+w,y+h . If you want to turn this into a function for checking overlap, you just need to return true if all the conditions in the tutorial are false, but return false if any of the conditions are true. Below is a verbose example function that assumes you have two boxes ( a and b ) that each have an x,y and w,h . The second function is the same as the first, but it's condensed into one statement. It's not as easy to read, but it does the same thing. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load overlap in the command line mode of PICO-8. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. this is exactly what i was looking for, was trying to remember collisions and this helps tons. Very poggers Much thanks This is an AMAZING tutorial, thank you!!! This just helped me out SO much, thx a lot! THANKS A LOT! this saved me a lot of frustration :P Thanks for this! One note for anyone who sees this code in the future: with this code, an 8x8 sprite has a width/height of 7. If you want to treat the width/height as 8, subtract 1 from the width and height in each of the lines above when comparing This is wonderful, thanks! The function both makes perfect sense _and_ does everything I want. I have put a thank you and a link to this cart in my code comments. This is super helpful!</TEXT>

Note: You can use as many or as few sprites as you want in the sp table, and in any order you want. Here's another implementation that assumes the tick , frame , and step variables and the sp table are all part of another table. (In this case, p , for player.) Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Is there a downloadable version of this cart available? I like looking at the code behind your tutorials :) very useful stuff. Thanks for all the learning you've provided! hey for people who dont know how to trigger the animation with a button can u make a tutorial for them I was struggling to animate 16x16 sprites until I used your code. Massive Thanks! Oh, hello! How to you animate 16x16 sprites? im trynig putting a "+1" on the spr function for wide and hight but prints more sprites on the spritesheet! (glitchy) spr(p.sp[p.f],x,y,p.sp[p.f]+1,p.sp[p.f]+1) You would just use spr(p.sp[p.f], x, y, 2, 2) where the 2,2 indicates the width and height (in units of 8x8 sprites) of the sprite you want to draw. thank you so much! Thank you for this tutorial! Also, there is a syntax error in line 3 (a dot before p.f ). Very good explanation, thank you! I think this could be made a bit smaller by making use of FLR() to divide the modulos. Since it's one-sprite, maybe don't need 2-variables to keep track of it ? Maybe ... Exactly what I needed! Thank you very much! Modulus is totally the secret sauce. You just reduced my 2 hour struggle to figure that out into a handful of code. Thanks! this is excellent , and general purpose. thank you!</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Map-Based Grid Movement</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates simple map-based grid movement. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. Notes: Sprites that you want to be blocking tiles (meaning the player can't walk through them), should have the first sprite flag turned on. The basic idea is that when the player tries to move, we store the coordinates of where they are trying to go. Then we check those new coordinates to see if the map tile in that spot has a sprite flag of 1 or not. If it does, we just ignore the player's attempt at moving. But if it doesn't, we change the player's location to the new coordinates and play a footstep sound. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load grid_movement in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Movement with Map Collision</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates how to have simple pixel movement that can use the map to block movement. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. Notes: Sprites that you want to be blocking tiles (meaning the player can't walk through them), should have the first sprite flag turned on. The basic idea is that when the player tries to move, we first check the new location they are trying to move to in both the left/right and up/down directions. If that position has a map tile with a sprite flag of 1 under it, we ignore player movement in that direction. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder.

<TEXT>This cart demonstrates adding pickups to your game. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. (Functions that are already covered in the Movement with Map Collision cart are not commented.) Notes: This cart uses a function called overlap(a,b) to determine if the player has run into a pickup. Use the Checking For Overlap cart to see how that function works. The basic idea is that when the player moves, we go through the list of pickups and see if the player's current position overlaps any of the pickups. If they do overlap, we remove that pickup, add to the player's coin score, and play a coin sound. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load pickups in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Game States</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates how to have different game states for your game. (Such as menu, game, game over, etc.) Notes: The basic idea is that PICO-8 normally runs _update() and _draw() 30 times a second. Instead of putting all our code into those two functions, we make separate update and draw functions for each of the states we need for the game. Then we have a variable called state that stores which state the game is currently in. Then, based on that variable, _update() and _draw() will run the appropriate update and draw function for the current state. (Such as menu_update() and menu_draw() for the menu state. Notes: The basic idea is that PICO-8 normally runs _update() and _draw() 30 times a second. However, because you can treat functions like variables, you can store one function's code in another function. So for changing states, we just make our own separate _update() and _draw() functions for each state. Such as menu_update() and menu_draw() for the menu state. Then we make an _init() function for each state, such as menu_init() that re-assigns _update() to menu_update() and _draw() to menu_draw() . Then PICO-8 will run those functions 30 times a second until we say otherwise. Save these files to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load the one you want by typing either load game_states_simple or load game_states_advanced in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8:  Camera Follow</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates how to get the camera to follow the player. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. Notes: The basic idea is that the camera always shows a 128x128 block of pixels, usually starting at pixel coordinate 0,0 . But you can use the camera() function to change which pixel the camera starts at if you want to show a different block of 128x128 pixels, such as, say, the block of pixels centered around the player. This cart uses the mid() function to ensure the camera doesn't go too far and show area that's off the map. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load camera_follow in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Gravity</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart is a simple example of how to add gravity to an object in your game. Notes: The basic idea is that in addition to storing the position of an object, you also its speed in both the x and y directions. Then, every update, you add just a little bit to the y speed. The result is the appearance of the object having gravity. To then make it bounce, you just decide where you want a wall to be, and if the object goes past that spot, you reverse the speed in the direction it hit the wall. To make it more realistic, when you reverse the speed's direction, you also make the speed just a little bit smaller, as if the wall absorbed some of the speed. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load gravity in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Fill Patterns</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart is to demonstrate how the PICO-8 fill pattern function works. You can also use it to try out different fill patterns. Notes: The fillp() function takes a 16-bit number to represent the pattern. The 16-bit number are the 16 pixels of a 4x4 grid, with each bit as one pixel. Once set, you can use a two-digit hexadecimal number to represent the two colors of the fill pattern. If you add .1 to the end of the 16-bit pattern number, the first color in the pattern (represented by 0 's) becomes transparent. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load fill_patterns in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Map Screens</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates how to have different map screens that follows the player around the map. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. Notes: The basic idea is that the camera is usually pinned to 0,0. We also track which 16x16 section of the map the player is standing on, and pin the camera to show that section of the map. This code is based off the Map-Based Grid Movement cart, but this will also work with pixel-based movement without any real code changes. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder.

<TITLE>PICO-8: Smooth Map Screens</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates how to have different map screens that follows the player around the map, with smooth transitions as the camera moves from map screen to map screen. This cart adds onto the Map Screens cart. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. Notes: The basic idea is that instead of just setting the camera position exactly to match the current map screen, the camera position is moved smoothly to match the current map scree. It does this by percentages, instead of by exact, set amounts of movement. This means that when the camera is far away, it will move quickly, but as the camera gets closer to the current map screen, it slows down smoothly until it comes to a stop. This creates a very clean, smooth transition from screen to screen. The speed that this occurs can be easily set with a single variable. As with the Map Screens cart, this code is based off the Map-Based Grid Movement cart, but this will also work with pixel-based movement without any real code changes. However, the comments in this cart only pertain to the smooth camera transitions. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder. Then load it by typing load map_screens_smooth in the command line mode of PICO-8.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8: Particles</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart demonstrates how to create particle systems. It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved. Notes: The basic idea is that you create a table to hold all of the particles and then every frame you go through that table, updating and drawing each particle in that table. How you update and draw each particle is up to you. The secret to a good particle system is having enough variables for each particle so that there is good variety in the particles as they are created. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder.

<TITLE>PICO-8: Movement with Inertia</TITLE>
<TEXT>This cart shows how to move a player with smooth movement, and inertia to slow the player down. Notes: The basic idea is that instead of moving the player by specific pixel amounts, you just add to the player's speed when you press the movement buttons. Then, if the movement buttons are not being pressed, the player's speed will decrease until they come to a stop. This cart also has a more complex function for collision detection. Instead of just immediately stopping the player from moving if they try to move into a wall, the function will find out how far they can move and move them there instead.

Then _update() happens 30 times a second over and over again. _draw() also happens 30 times a second, but after _update() happens. Save this file to your PICO-8 carts folder.

<TITLE>Pico-8 Orrery</TITLE>
<TEXT>A very simple solar system simulation. Uses orbital elements from NASA JPL Solar System Dynamics Group . Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Nice little thing that would be real cool to have as a watch. Minor bug: There's a year 0 JAN 0 but year 0 JAN 1 should jump to year -1 DEC 31 Ah, good point. I collected a whole bunch of Julian-day-number-to-date conversion functions off the internet and then ended up having to write my own from scratch because they all relied on 32-bit integer arithmetic. I imagine there are probably other problems with my converter as well. For instance, the Gregorian calendar started in the 1500s; before that it was the Julian calendar, which differed by a couple of days at the 1AD mark. Probably better to use the Gregorian to go back in time, though, because it matches the solar year better. Also the planet positions are unlikely to be accurate more than a few hundred years out. Mercury, in particular, has a large first derivative on its orbital elements. It would be fairly easy to add the first derivatives of the orbital elements in; JPL provides those.</TEXT>

<TITLE>PICO-8 Dodge</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is my first game on PICO-8 and my first-ever game. It was initially a practicing demo for learning lua and PICO-8 development, so simple that you can not do anything other than move a cube. Then my friend told me I could add some random walls (which became bullets in the end). If the cube touches the wall, the game is over. I thought it was a good idea, so I just tried to make it out. The whole process was full of fun and thinking, it took me about 10 hours to get everything done, including reading lua & PICO-8 docs, coding, drawing, and debugging. One thing worth mentioning is that I got huge influence and encouragement from people's reaction to this tweet: https://twitter.com/novoreorx/status/999974039681622017 , many people came to say hi and retweet, even though it's just a piece of poor newbie code (which can be found here , in case you are interested). Thanks to everyone who paid attention to it. This project, even tiny and simple, is far from complete. Here are some tasks I plan to do later: Glory to PICO-8 and indie game development. ð Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.

<TITLE>PICO-8 fillp tool</TITLE>
<TEXT>A little helper tool for generating fillp patterns. Output is provided as hexadecimal sum (most compact), binary sum (easiest to read), and decimal addition (verbose; matches PICO-8 example). Click on output to copy to clipboard. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I am running Pico-8 0.2.5c and it appears the background and foreground colors are inversed. Additionally, I can't get alpha to work, or it might be that part isn't inversed? Edited a few times as I discover more about this that might help you figure it out. Most importantly, I have to say - This is a very helpful tool!!! I just tried it out on v0.2.5c and it seems to be working as expected (images below), though I think I may see the source of your confusion: If you don't change the colours in the tool and also don't set a colour in pico-8, then it will appear to be reversed, because the default colours in this tool don't match pico-8's default. I can update the default colour selection in the tool so that's less confusing in the future. I'm not sure what you mean by the alpha bit though, could you provide more detail or some code to show what you mean? Hi Sean, Sorry for the late response! I will check notification settings. By alpha I mean like a graphic alpha channel (transparency). In Pico-8 black is transparent. In my case, I'm making a particle explosion and using shift-e and shift-b in the function FILLP(E) or FILLP(B) (where it shows the dotted pattern in place of E and B, with the built in patterns; which use color 0 as an alpha, and my chosen color as the fill pattern. In your red/yellow example above, if the Red was color 0 (black), it would be transparent and you would only see yellow diagonal lines. Any circle filled with that pattern would show the yellow lines and what isn't yellow would show the game graphics under the fill where the color 0 is. I'm new to programming but I did a lot of graphic work, so I might not be explaining it well. I thought this would help me fade out a filled circle by changing through a series of patterns with less and less coverage. That's what I'm doing now with the Shift-E and Shift-B, but I only get 2 steps of fade where I'd like about 5 or 7. Again, I love this tool, I can't thank you enough for your contributions to the community!!! I appreciate it! Ah, I think I understand what you're trying to do. "Transparent" isn't a colour to select in PICO-8 (it defaults to treating black as transparent, but you can modify that with PALT), and the FILLP function allows you to set part of the pattern to transparent (regardless of colour) using additional binary bits. Using the previous example, you could call FILLP(0x8421 + 0b.1) and it will render transparent where the yellow is. There's more detail on this feature in the PICO-8 user manual here . I assume when you're using the special characters shift-e and shift-b, it's using a pattern that already has that bit set, but if you want to use custom patterns you can add 0b.1 to any pattern you create. Thank you so much for that tip! I'll certainly dig into the manual and add this to my own quick notes. I will put this to use!!! I just tried this out, and it's exactly what I needed to make a smooth fade (given the color and resolutions limitations, haha) This is perfect! excellent tool, thank you! I'd add a 'random' button for experimenting :) Very nice! I was messing around with the sprite editor and map editor trying to fake this in stock PICO-8, but this is exactly what I needed for what I was doing :D This is great and VERY useful - thanks for creating it! :D If you're at all looking for feature suggestions - it'd be great if this also allowed you to pick colours and set the transparency option, as this is the bit I tend to get stuck on! Thanks again Thanks for the feedback! I'm not sure what the UI for the transparency would look like, but I added a colour picker. In the meantime, you can copy the binary output and add .1 to get transparency. That's great Sean - this will DEFINITELY be a lifesaver going forward. Thanks again! :D Fantastic tool, will definitely be making use of this a lot! I made a similar tool! but never thought on using hex values. That's great :D</TEXT>

<TITLE>Pico-8 Workshop Example</TITLE>
<TEXT>This pico-8 game was the result of a pico-8 workshop demonstrating different aspects of pico-8. The game is quite clearly inspired by Pacman, and made in less time than Pacman. This is the file from the workshop that I made on-the-fly during a workshop I gave, with a few additional bits I added when staying over in Limerick. As a game it's nothing special, just simple movement and enemies that follow you. The aim was to show different tools that come with pico-8, a rapid prototyping process and enough material to wet their beaks! Big thanks to the Pico-8 community for sharing such awesome resources. THE WORKSHOP I was asked by the Game Development Society of the University of Limerick to deliver a talk or workshop on Pico-8 in advance of their third ever gamejam. My workshop was largely a success. There were about 20 students who turned up on the night. A lot more than I had expected! The students followed along live-coding, asking questions, laughing to themselves about their creations. The workshop was less than 2 hours long. After the workshop I spent a few hours working on the game, instead of sleeping, and uploaded it here. Hopefully it will show the students just how quickly they can make things and share them. Hopefully some of them will consider using Pico-8 at the next UL Gamejam! Time will tell. Overall the workshop was a lot of fun and I'd love to do it again (and better!).

Seven Deadly Sins Onslaught: Confront the seven deadly sins nightmarish manifestations. Pick your weapon: Select your weapon of choice, decide between a razor-sharp blade or a ranged and powerful firearm. Tailor your combat style to suit your strategy! You can read more about the gameplay in the guide! Listen up: When voices meet sound design, the in-game sounds are fully voice-made. It's as if you are the narrator inside your own mind. Immerse yourself: Explore a new dimension: our game's combination of 2D- and 3D-Art offers you a mind-bending experience! 50 Shades of Magenta: Experience a world painted in monochrome colors and bring back nostalgic memories of the old retro titles. We are nine German trainees from the Macromedia Academy Cologne: This project is our 4th semester project and we put a lot of passion and work into it. We had around 3 months and a few key points that we had to include which are: It's been a journey and sometimes it was hard to find enough time between our lessons but we are proud to show what we came up with. Probably there won't be any further development in the future. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I really like the art and omg....I LOVE THE MUSIC!!! The difficulty could use some balancing imo(or maybe im just really bad) could not get past wave 4 without getting overrun. I think it would be a nice touch if you could see your current progression towards the quest. Otherwise I think this is a really solid little game. Keep up the energy. Thanks a lot for your feedback!! :) Great to hear some input from outside our bubble regarding the balancing. Just played, and honestly, I think if it had some clean up over the quality of the images of some files (i.e the rocks being a different res than the enemy sprites). I know the rocks are 3D models (and btw, love the different mediums used in this game!! really creative) but there could be some polishing done for that. Also, I might be biased but It'd be nice if the title screen was animated too! Would add a nice touch to the overall aesthetic! Overall, I love the simple artstyle and the color palette, it's really eye-pleasing, the character designs too! In summary, Mind Hunter has some serious potential, if only polished a little bit, keep it up, everybody!!! :) Thank you so much for your feedback it's very much appreciated! We really like the idea of the animated title screen and will implement a little animation this week. c:</TEXT>

If it's the browser version, which broswer are you using and have you already tried clearing your chache? It's the browser version, I'm using Google Chrome and I admittedly don't know what "clearing your Chache" is- Click the three dot menu icon in the upper right corner, select "More Tools" > "Clear Browsing Data". Select "Cookies and Other Site Data" and "Cached Images and Files," then click "Clear Data." If that doesn't fix it, I'm not sure I can do much since this since this is the first and only time I've ever seen this error and I haven't been able to replicate it, I'm sorry :( If you don't mind replaying to that point, I would recommend playing the downloaded version. i want a portuguese translation ;((((((((( There are several problems with your Linux version. It may be a compatibility problem with the latest Ubuntu versions only. I tried to solve all the ones I can but there's a.dat file that seems just out of date with the system and I can't do much about it. Web version seems to work find though. I think rpgmaker mv only exports to a very specific (and old) linux version, I couldn't get any of my games to work on my steamdeck either, for example. I've left it up for the few people it does work for (same with the mac version), but it's definitely not ideal :( Sorry you went through the trouble of trying to fix something that was doomed from the start it's fine as I said the web version is working fine it's just that I thought I might aswill report it but that makes sense I love this game sm ive played for atleast an hour i just gotta get off before i overload my small brain. i plan to come back to it but i gotta find a new game so my brain dosent malfunction. currently stuck but still LOVE it i have no words to say thats so peak...I love how in first time its look likes some cute game, but it has awell written plot with interesting characters and u get stuck in it for at least an hours. how many end it have? I love this game, I dunno what ending I got but I'm definitely going to play this again!!! I love Fio sm, I WILL protect him with my whole life!!! I gasped so many times during this game, the story is just perfect. (I'm also one of the people who almost cried...) â¡ I got endings 1 and 5, next up 8! Two different ratings from two people who played this at once. Both five stars, for probably different reasons: Person 1: I honestly almost cried finding out what was happening and honestly I cheered when Sofia died. Also I adore Fio. Person 2: Great story-writing elements, great plot, and such a specific use of silence, lack of colours, music, and everything to string it all together to a perfectly tragic tale. Will keep these writing elements in mind. Definitely didn't nearly scream at some of the spookier parts, but that makes it all the better. 10/10, would get traumatised to again. i got two endings so far and DAMMN poor fio... why is there a bunch of numbers? because math is scary oh haha so true tho math is cool until the alphabet starts coming in Me gusto mucho saque un final en un dÃ­a! pero hay alguna guia para los otros finales? no se muy bien que hacer para conseguirlos T-T esta en espaÃ±ol? how can i open up the Menu ? im paying on the website and i dont know how to open it.. pls help meeee the menu pops up when you press escape on the keyboard This game was pretty good. The whole story and the concept of it were just amazing. I need more like this. Loved the atmosphere and how it started over after Fio or Crow died again. That was pretty cool. Wow, this game was really good! The whole plot is really interesting. I really connected with the characters and wanted everyone to be happy. on the mac ver of the game it says that there has been an error and that i should report it. is that just me...? I've made a statement regarding the mac version in the description, (right above the 'for content creators' section) unfortunately it doesn't work properly on newer devices my bad i did not read that. the game was very interessting! I like that what you do before going to bed makes a difference for the ending, but how could you not play with him?!?!?! Thats so cute! Its also very disturbing, but it's an horror game with a big warning so it's what you're expecting^^Â° I liked it! The art ist also very cute! OK SO I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS. Huge spoilers ahead for- uh- one specific ending DONT READ IF HAVEN'T PLAYED So about the ending where there's a pandemic I DON'T GET WHAT HAPPENED THERE AT ALL?? What exactly happened for the world to end?? Did Crow cause this? Is this toxic gas in the atmosphere the same one Icarus gifted us? And about the iterations, everytime Fio died, did a new iteration replace him every single time?? Would that mean there's actually no real Fio? Also, what was Icarus's motive for killing Fio over and over again? I haven't got the other endings yet so idk if that's explained but anyways I'm actually really interested in the lore I wanna know everything :(( why have you stolen my brain and all the thoughts in it? This is an incredible game. The nuances were fascinating and disturbing, and stayed with me long after I stopped playing, or 'became a god.' I do hope someone can list the 8 endings so I can see which ones I haven't achieved yet, though. Me stopping playing cus FIOOOOOO NOOOOO will be playing again for the other endings! this was so gooood also it doesn't work on older linux devices, however, i used crouton and not crostini because my computer just won't let me. The game will open but it gives you a "UnknownError: illegal access". NOOOO NOT FIOOOOOO BTW i loved the game!!! I got the 4th Ending, which is pretty decent as well as the 8th one BUT i still need a guide to 8th End as well as the other endings, is there any way link to know the guide for all of them? i cant even say goodbye to Fio even though i played with him everyday and even found the code in the drawer :(( LET ME KISS HIM GOODBYE BUT HOW!!?!?! i'm sorry if this has already been asked and answered or is plainly shown in the description somewhere but is there a soundtrack for the game that's out? i really enjoyed the music lol :> or if the music is pulled from other places what the names of those pieces are THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING GAME OMG (I am crying tho bc I WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY) I'm so happy I was blessed with the chance to play this game, like one of the comments said earlier, it made me so sad to have completed it. Nothing will ever measure up :,) Okay first of all how dare you do that to Fio?? He's the sweetest of little guys and the only thing that he deserved in this game was Crow. Second of all, this game is amazing and I desperately need more. My friend & I played the whole thing in a couple sessions and it's one of those games that has you so hooked that you genuinely feel a little sad once you've completed it. the game seems really good though i am not done with the game just yet! but is there a way to save your game progress yourself so you dont lose progress with the autosaves? Absolutely enjoyed playing this game. What a creative story and amazing art. Thank you very much!! what are the controls awesome game! I did et stuch though one the run after fioâs fourth death (I think it was the fourth) This story was so good. I went in completely blind and it blew me away this game was genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. As a person planning to major in psychology and minor in philosophy this horror game in its entirety was an amazing experience. I was truly baffled by how this game effected me. The ending and all. I genuinely love this game with all my heart! <3 Good game, loves the design and the "old theme" !! and the music are amazing 10/10 Super good game, I enjoyed this a lot! I got stuck on some parts but eventually I got it. 10/10 game, one of the best ones on this website.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Ashens in 'Who Stole My Sofa?'</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game In 2014, Stuart Ashen uploaded a choose-your-own-adventure style video series to Youtube, which relied on Youtube's annotation service to function. Unfortunately, said functionality is being removed from the service on January 15, 2019. This removal will cause the whole thing to break on that date. To prevent that, I moved all of the annotations into a Twine game with convenient embedded videos, so you can (mostly) experience the cutting edge click-on-a-video action like it's 2014 all over again. I threw this together over the course of a few hours so I fully expect horrific mistakes and exploding computers. Let me know if you experience issues. (Speaking of issues, I'm not offering this directly in your browser because itch doesn't seem to like the embedded Youtube videos and won't even render the player. Holler at me if you have ideas.

This moon curses the land turning the animals into MONSTERS. It's up to you save all your friends and remove the curse. The demo allows you to play all levels in the Forest Land, and the first level of the other 3 lands. There are also 3 hidden mini games accessible, 2 bonus flying games and one fishing game. The fishing game is still a rough work in progress. You can play the game in your browser or download and play on your Gameboy Color, or Analogue Pocket. Thank you for playing.

The game is done, we (me and Bitmap Soft) are working on getting the game ready for a physical release. It should be coming soon. Nice! I love that I was able to play right in my browser full screen with Gameboy controls without installing anything. Fun music too! This was really fun! It feels like an official game I would have played on my atomic purple Game Boy Color back in 2000! I can't wait until it's finished! Nice work, just done the tutorial and had a look around the map, looking forward to delving further. Cute, fun, and great music & art! Can't wait to play the full game :) I'm glad this wasn't around when I was 8, because not having a GameBoy would have sucked even harder. It is STINKING CUTE <3<3<3 That means so much to me to hear that. Thank You. Fantastic presentation and concept. Look forward to future updates. Thank you very much. This is fantastic, feels like it could have been a proper studio release for the GBC, really polished and charming, definitely playing some more of it! Thank you so much. This is exactly what I'm trying to create. A long lost game that was never released and only just discovered. Really good stuff, love your animation work! Thank you. Absolutely amazing demo. Graphics are on-par with most first-party Nintendo titles of yesteryear. Music is full of bopping tunes that always bring a smile. Your clever level design always feels fresh. You have a masterpiece on your hands, here, for certain! Thank you for those kind words, that's a lot to live up too. I will do my best. Your graphics and environments are so good. I love the water lilies. You inspire me! Thank you, that means a lot coming from you. Lovely game! visually pleasing and cute Thank you.</TEXT>

Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. hello I'm playerxty and today I was looking for some to analyze and I found yours so let's go. graphics: the graphics are great since the proposal is similar to the classic games. gameplay: except for some errors in the collision mask (the player holds the wall) the rest is fine. level design: well he is average because he is successful in using the player, but he has much more creative ways of using mechanics. main problem: FEEDBACK knows that time when you are playing mario and you are attacked by an enemy the mario automatically flashes and is small indicating that he took damage the same valley when he catches the mushroom. I think this is missing in your warning to the player what is happening for example the first time I played the game the only collectible that I noticed was the diamond due to its more blue color that stands out in the scenery but the rest for example the plant of life I went straight because both the character and the plant did not react or demonstrated that something happened I think that a green '+' effect after you took it already solved the problem. other than that I really liked your game ð</TEXT>

<TITLE>SOFIA</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows The game was made for United with Ukraine game jam. Everything including art, music, gameplay were made just in 40 hours. The topic was: HERITAGE OF UKRAINE For centuries, we have shared our culture and traditions in a common Europe - a continent open to diversity and united in a common destiny. Do you know what the origin of some of those traditions are in the past? What traditions were in place over the Middle Ages? What did people think about and do on a daily basis? Let your games bring to life the creation process of a common European identity and the key position of Ukraine in Europe. Let your games show pride, bravery and character. Let's join together and demonstrate our common heritage. Description Our team came up with an idea with a magic book that allows the player not only to read boring information, but also gives the opportunity to fully immerse yourself in history and become part of it. Now you can learn everything about the culture and customs of the country you are interested in, and you will do it in the form of a game. Learning history has never been so exciting. At the moment the book can tell a couple of stories about Ukrainian culture, but we hope to go beyond one country and add many different cultures and traditions in the future. Experience different cultures through Sofia's slumber in this brand new top-down 2D storytelling game! CONTROLS W, A, S, D / Arrows - Move F - Interact ASSETS All the assets have been done from scratch by our team.

I played this to the end and enjoyed it -- nice job!! It's an impressively expansive map for the time you had, which meant I spent more time with this game. The metroidvania sequencing is nicely done. It had some nice challenges, the heart-drops were nicely tuned, and I thought the checkpoints were well spaced. The look and behavior of the floating flower bubbles was creative and it was something different. My absolute favorite element here was the look of the upgraded sword (the smear frame) -- it was a welcome surprise that made me smile. In terms of (hopefully helpful) feedback, I think adding invincibility after taking a hit (to avoid having the player get stuck in damage-loops) would be the change that would give you the biggest reward for your time. I know you've heard it, but sometimes it's nice to hear opinions from different players. It was fun, nice work! Hey thanks for the reply, I am sorry to say that we are not updating the game anymore, both me and Riu are undergrad entering our final year but we are planing on participating in at least one more MVM this year. hm. There is definitely a good Metroidvania skeleton here, but there are also many issues. The character feels extremely stiff… the physics just feel really janky. The wall grab constantly caught my character while jumping, and then you have to wait a couple seconds to unstick from the wall. There are no invincibility frames after taking damage, so you can quickly drain all your health. The map says â8/8 pickupsâ right from the beginning, and getting new abilities doesnât change that. The abilities themselves are just words… So itâs impossible to know when you actually got them (the health upgrade pickup didnât actually add any health to my character). The level design and room designs are extremely basic and never pose much challenge, just a couple jumps and your done. For bugs, my character got stuck in a wall once but otherwise it was smooth sailing. But for a game jam, I can see potential in it. If those issues were fixed, the room design refined, more enemies and interesting mechanics… it could be a solid game None of the upgrades worked because I forgot to remove the debug object from the first room, it gives you all the pickups from the start. Sorry ð¬ I really liked the art, but there are a lot of repetitive enemies. Good job Thanks for the reply. Yeah there are only 5 types of enemy, I thought the map would end up being smaller and the art took a lot more time then we planned so we couldn't fit more variety. But it's still good Thanks :) Cool game. I like your level design. Good job done, respect) Thank you for the review! :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Sofia the Witch Curse of the Monster Moon - Demo</TITLE>
<TEXT>For Gameboy Color and Analog Pocket Pre-Orders of the full game available from Bitmap Soft. Every 500 years the stars align with the lunar eclipse creating the fabled Monster Moon . The moon turns green and Curses the land turning the animals into MONSTERS. It's up to you to save all your friends and remove the Curse of the Monster Moon . You play as Sofia, a plucky little witch that will do whatever she can to save her friends from their terrible curse. You have 2 spells at the ready. When Sofia is Red use the Transmogrification spell. It will transform monsters back into your friends. When Sofia is Blue use the Bubble Bounce spell. It allows you to create a bubble to bounce off of. Explore the world of Luna Haven and the 4 different lands within it. Explore the dark woods of Forest Land. There are tall trees and caves to explore here. Water and witches don't mix. You'll have to watch your step as you traverse over the giant lily pads. Hot and dry, filled with hidden catacombs and quicksand. Keep on your toes here. High up where it's windy and wet. There are updrafts and giant bouncy mushrooms to help you get around here. The sacred moonwell is an ancient and tranquil place. Acquiring all 4 moonstones may reveal its secrets. Along your journey you may come across some unique NPC's that will give you a task to complete. Hop on your broom and try to complete those tasks. If you're successful you may get something special. Every good game needs a fishing mini game, if only you can find the secret fishing hole. There are so many more things to do in Sofia the Witch. It's a land full of secret areas, hidden mini games, hidden bosses, and a variety of unique residents. In the full version of the game, there are 4 large bosses, 1 at the end of each land. Hidden within each of the 4 lands there is also a secret hidden boss. If you can find and defeat all 4 of them you might unlock something cool. There are also 6 different endings. The one you get depends on how many friends you've changed back and how many secrets you've found. One last thing, if you've made it this far. The game is speedrunner friendly. On the title screen hit Select when starting a new game, and select speedrun mode. This will allow you skip the tutorial of getting your wand and learning your spells. In the full game you can skip cut scenes too. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it. You can play the game in your browser, on your phone/tablet in full screen mode or download the rom and play on your Gameboy Color, Analogue Pocket, or the emulation player of your choice. This demo allows you to play all 4 levels in Forest Land. You can also play the First Level in the other 3 lands. In the demo there are 6 secret areas hidden in the game. 2 bonus flying mini games. A mini game where you play as a cat. A fishing game. As well as 2 hidden mini bosses. Thank you for checking out and playing Sofia the Witch Curse of the Monster Moon.

Solid gameplay, lovely pixel art and animation. Special shoutout to the soundtrack, some of the catchiest tunes I have heard in a GBC game! Very cute! Ill definitely check it out I enjoyed playing the demo. I especially appreciated the theme of turning monsters back into friends. This was so incredibly fun. Love the game variation. This is so clean and well made. I'm excited for the game's release based on what I've played so far. I am a bit confused/disappointed by the map layout though. Why is World 1 further away than World 3? I assume you can play levels in any order? Will there be a health upgrade available? Two health is not much. As for the location and numbering of the worlds. There really is no impact in the order you complete them since its up to you to decide in what order you want to play them, the world is basically open. The health is always consistent at one heart, but you can take 3 hits before failing a level, and your health refills between levels unless you're playing Retro mode. When will the full rom be sold? Thank you I got the physical game—finally! I've been waiting for this for so long. Congratulations on the release! I absolutely love the illustrations on the box and in the manual. About a year ago, I played the demo, and now Iâm so excited to dive into the full game! :D Also, I made an unboxing video for those who are interested: OMG! Thank you for this. I haven't received my copy yet. Does the physical cart actually use a save state battery like the picture shows? No, that was just for mock up purposes. A really cute game!! Hopefully it'll be completed one day!! Is the full version of the rom going to be available to purchase on itch I too would like to know this! Would absolutely love the option to buy the rom instead of having to get the physical cart It should be after we have the physical version out there. I know not everyone wants to or has the ability to play off a cartridge. Since I haven't seen any updates as of this post: I have been able to purchase the Digital Edition on the BitmapSoft website and play it on OpenEmu on macOS, on the ModRetro Chromatic & original hardware via an Everdrive X7 cart, as well as on an RG Cube XX running Knulli top notch pixel art and very lovely executed beginning of the story :) WHY IS THE GB/SGB WARNING!!! That warning should only be showing up if you try to play the game on a regular gameboy. The game wasn't designed visually to run on it. Just about all the backgrounds would look terrible. The Super Gameboy should work fine as far as I know, I unfortunately do not have one to test with. Super Game Boy is not GB Color compatible, so it is really a regular GB with borders. Excellent demo, the aesthetics of the game are beautiful, the music matches perfectly, I will be attentive to future updates and the full game! Made a video Thank you so much for making a video. I love seeing how people play game. It lets me see where I can tweak some of the difficulty too. Happy we could help you with the video and yeah it's a lot different to see someone else play your game compared to how you would play it. My kids and I loved this demo, and we can't wait to play the full game! Cute sprites, lovely music, and fun gameplay! It's a family-friendly game that can still present a challenge, and has a lot of replay value to find hidden areas. Going to get a cart as soon as it comes out.. Thanks again for streaming it on your twitch channel it was a blast watching you play. Fully agree. I played together with my son and he loves the game! That's amazing to hear. Thank you . Can't wait to play this new demo! The graphics look so colorful and smooth I loved the demo, the art is beautiful, the music is charismatic. The level design is consistent, exploring its magic mechanics very well. I got a great "Super Mario Land 2" vibe, and the details like petting the cat or sleeping in bed add a neat touch. The game certainly has great potential. Nice work! Lovely demo! Super cute graphics, fun gameplay and the music is so good! I played 2 levels and loved it, I downloaded the rom to try it on my Anbernic as well, can't wait to play the full game :) i like the game but the pc controls is pretty bad.</TEXT>

SPECIAL GIRLS STORY (mirror 1) clocks in at 121,386 words in its current rough start to finish state. its been a huge undertaking that is finally almost to the finish line, but i still have quite a lot of work to do before its actually done. my issues have halted my ability to work on it altogether. i really do not want to resort to having to release unfinished product just so i can survive to finish it. even if i could, my state is bad enough i can't work. this bunny briefcase is my compromise...any help is appreciated, i hope you enjoy the gifts in return. !!!

<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows It's 2200 and all history books have been destroyed by the newly formed agency S.M.A.T. in order to prevent conflict and war betweeen nations. Your job is to find the books protected by the S.M.A.T. officers and prove that there are other better ways to prevent war. You will play as Sofia and Thomas, the two characters have their own unique graphics, yet are similar because of being siblings. The S.M.A.T. officers have their own AI with patrolling systems that are different and random each time. They also have their own field of vision, avoid it not to raise the alarm. Your goal is to get the book at the end of each level, it will usually be on higher ground. In order to get to the book you will need to activate some platforms by pressing a button, always guarded by a S.M.A.T. officer. Each level has more than one way it can be won, it is up for you to decide which way you win. The game features uncompressed and beautiful high quality graphics that work on even the really bad computers (And I am talking even "intergrated graphics card" type of bad). Walk: A & D or Left-Arrow & Right-Arrow. Jump: Space. Restart-Level (in case of a bug or glitch): "L" - (lower case). Open the zip folder and double click the .exe file.

Hello, i want buy this pack but i no have good payment method from poland. Please give me contact to you. Hi! I'm working on an open source project, and I'd like to use your pack in it (It will fit perfectly with my design). I'd like to ask if I'm allowed to to push files I'll use to github, or should I keep them only locally? Yes, you can use them for open source projects but they can be only used inside the project and project variations. cool! Is there anything that you want me to write in readme, about icons and copyright? Hi, is it allowed to modify these? I noticed you didn't mention anything about it in the description, and there wasn't a specific license given. Hi, yes, you can modify these for your projects (personal & commercial) but you are not allowed to re-sell variations made out of them as assets. Hi, just want to make sure, can we use/share a purchased asset to more than one game/ more than one game developer? Or it just licensed as a single product (one license for one game only). Yes, you can use the asset pack between different projects you are working on. Just don't re-sell it or redistribute it it to other entities you are not part of. Thats great thanks! Not a problem, I hope you'll find a great use of these :) yeahh :D This is really awesome!! i was wondering if it was allowed to be used For twitch streams aswell. i m asking cause i want to be certain <3 Of course, you can use the icons for anything you like! :) The only rule is not to redistribute the assets in any way (reselling / re-sharing). this is awesome! currently developing my first game with a friend and i had no idea where to start for the art haha. huuuge help and really pretty! :) Yeah, starting out may be hard sometimes, I hope this will be of help, thank you! :) Thank you so much for making this!

You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. just picked this up, really great set. I appreciate the documentation on how best to use some of the layers and patterns. Easily the most professional asset pack I've come across. The included html instructions make it a joy to use! hallo guten tag. das sieht wirklich sehr schick aus :) 1: Idle, select, hit are 3 frames. Move, attack, are 4 frames. There are also some extra frames for facing left/right/up, but they are not animated. 2: Idle/select are only down-facing. You can extend and edit the assets as you see fit. 3: You can share freely and no credit is required. This is really great, Pita. Amazing work. The documentation makes the assets much easier to use. The whole package is perfectly organized. Can't wait for the next bundle. Hi!, the assets look great and I like to buy this for my dream game prototype and I have some questions! 1: how many frames each animation have? 2: the character & slime have 4 direction idle frame?, if not can I add the missing frames? 3: can I share the game on social media freely or I need to give credit? (of course I will recommended your assets for everyone when I share it but credit its must in the game or something?) 4: the tileset support autotiles? I like to buy that tomorrow so I be glad if you answer me soon as possible! :) Is the character animated in all 8 directions? (including N S E W SW SE NW NE) or just the basic 4 directions? N S and E (flip to get W facing). Idle/select animation is S facing only. Hello Pita, can you kindly reply to my email? (Paolo N.) Thanks in advance Bought this tile set ages ago, finally get the chance to use it for a project. Incredible asset, specially the detailed instructions on how to use the asset pack. Great work! i need tons of monsters sprites not tilsets ... there are soo may tilsets here but soo little NPC sprites for topdown animations... Hello, I was wondering if you were for hire. I am an experienced game developer who is looking for a pixel artist to make a couple tilesets for a game I am working on. I have some experience working with pixelart, and I would be working alongside you. If you're interested, we can negotiate your payment; I am thinking I could pay you a portion in advance, and the rest after- a mutually beneficial deal I think. Cheers, TheAlchemist P.S. I really enjoy your art style so far. Great work, regardless of what you decide! Hello, I'm not available for hire at the moment. Best of luck with your game and thanks for the compliment! -Pita Hi Pita I'm currently creating a game using this pack (I think the monster pack was included too). I want to upload the demo version on itch.io. Am i allowed to do that? I'll give you credits. Thanks in advance Yes, you are allowed to use these assets in released projects, free or commercial. Go ahead. Credit is not strictly necessary, but welcome. Thanks. I think i will give you some credits, so more people can have a good experinece with your amazing pack. Hi, wanted to ask how the walk animation of the Hero looks like. Does one see the sword at all times? If Possible I'd like to use the character as a template and and overlay weapons/tools later, but if the weapon is part of the sprite's walk/idle that might be tricky. The sword is visible in all the animations, I'm afraid. Hello there I have a question (Btw I've bought this package). My question is about the idle animation. In the doc you wrote: " NOTE: There are still idle frames for up and side directions. I squeezed them into the sheet in rows 9,10,11, 4th column." I can't get what frames I have to use in addition to those you noted for making the idle for up and side.I mean for the normal idle I have 3 frames that I "ping-pong" and it works well but for up and side I have no clue. Thanks in advance Sorry for the confusion. There aren't any idle animations for the side/up directions, just stills. Oh sorry, my bad. English is not my native language. I translated "still" like "more" and not like "standing still". Anyway thanks for your reply. Any plans to add a death animation? For this and the monster pack? No plans for this, sorry! dude this is way to awesome to be real 0_0 one day i will buy it, it's only a matter of time :D Really, dude, this SOOOO awesome. I've literally never seen better dungeon tileset in my life. I'm gonna do a roguelike game soon, after i finish my current game. And of course, i'll buy your rpg monster pack too. I can't even describe how great this is. I'll also check all your assets, and mb buy some of them too :D Good bye, bro, Best one on the site, I've based a game I'm 700 hours in on, on this tileset. Slowly editing all of them to make it my own. Great place to start. I was able to get the walls going in Unity rule tiles. I'm working through the rest of it. It's useful that you provided a reference document. https://gyazo.com/59e4a439f7765a291b8f9f31f34e8f65 When I try to do Unity sprite editor and slice it into 16x16 pixel, it seems to be off. Any recommendations on settings I need to modify? I'm not an expert with Unity by any means, and haven't used Unity for a long time. I'd recommend asking the Unity community about this. There shouldn't be any offsets you need to make (the tiles are all aligned correctly), however there are issues with the 2D tile system in Unity and tearing, which might be what you're encountering. Again, I'm not an expert in Unity, so I'd recommend asking there about these problems. Hi Pita, great art! Do you plan for the future to create more humans, like an archer or mage characters? Keep up the awesome work! I've had this asset pack for a while and just logged in for the first time in ages on itch. I think it's fair I take the time to say that this asset pack has been one of the best I've ever used (along with the Village Tileset). If you're thinking of getting this, I don't think you'll regret it. Really great work Pita. I see you have a Unity setup for the Overworld. Any chance we could get the same for this? Or maybe you can give tips on how to use this or any of your other packages in Unity? I don't intend to make a unity package for this (or the Dungeon set). I don't know much about Unity so don't feel particularly comfortable giving specific advice about it. From memory, when I setting up the Overworld tileset for Unity I followed the instructions in the manual ( here ) and a blog post on the Unity blog ( here ). Things may have changed in Unity since that blog post and since I made that package. A quick search of 'unity tilemap' on youtube brings up more than a few more recent tutorials, so I'd probably start there. Sorry I can't help more! Thanks for the reply. I know a lot about Unity, but I come from the 3D world and I'm new to tilemaps and such. I did notice that there are some importers for unity that will take maps from Tiled and bring them in. Perhaps I'll give that a go. This is the asset that looks like it could do it. I just want to have auto tiling setup without having to spend too much time on it. I guess I'll roll up my sleeves and see how it goes. :D https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/sprite-management/tiled-tmx-importer-102928 I don't plan to add side/rear idle animations, sorry. Do these work well with RPG Maker VX Ace There are three main issues from memory (I'm not well-versed in RPG Maker): hi, I want to create a game using your sprites, but in my country 10 dollars is not a little money. Can you give me free? If so, then I will be extremely grateful to you. Myabe later i can buy village pack but not now... ð Really wait your answer. Sry for my English ð Are you open for commissions? We tried messaging you on Twitter but you don't have messages open. Hi, I'm not taking on any extra work currently. Thanks for asking. I'm sorry to hear that, but you have to do your own thing like everyone else right! I'd like to be put on the waiting list for when you are available, we are definitely interested. Thank you for your time, see ya! working on a phaser js game to learn stuff and this is what i have, they are all animated thanks for the asset! Good Day! Is there a color palette available that fits with the tileset? Thank you. You could extract the color palette yourself from the art assets. Awesome work. I would LOVE a bow animation for the main hero to add more variety to his attacks (like the goblin sniper). Yo! This asset pack is the shit! You are legendary for those included tileset and character guides for animations and tiling. Do you take commissions? Thanks! I'm not currently accepting commissions, sorry. Hi ! . Will there be a new Asset pack released , anytime soon ? really love your work Thanks! Can't say re: next pack. It could be a very long time away as I'm currently knees-deep on another project. Hi! Sorry for the noob question here. I see the tilemap is 16x16. When I put a 16x16 tilemap into Construct, everything looks so tiny and I can't even see it. Also your demo gifs don't look 16x16. Should I just scale tilemaps from 16x16 to 32 x 32 in an editor before importing to Construct? I'm new to gamedev so please excuse of there's some accepted process around this already that I missed. With modern screen resolutions and pixel art, you're going to need to do some sort of scaling to get the big pixels. I haven't used Construct before, so I can't give specific advice about that, but in general I would rather scale the pixel art in-engine rather than resizing the actual resources. I would be surprised if Construct doesn't have some way to do this, so you may want to ask in their forums about how other developers go about making pixel art games in that engine. It may be that they actually do scale the resources themselves, in which case you're right: just scale up the resources to the desired size in any image editor. Just make sure you scale in integers and without anti-aliasing so you don't get blurry or wonky pixels! Thanks a lot! This is a great tile set. Very clean and stylish. I also appreciate how you packaged them with example Tiled maps, the html guides, etc. Great stuff. Hey Pita, Your sprites are amazing. Trying to put them all in my new game right now. But I noticed there isn't any animation for death or failure. Is it possible to add them in new update? Otherwise I have to figure out another way, like blink and fade away something : ) Thank you so much. I don't plan to add special death animations, sorry. (another solution: the classic 'spin in a circle then explode!') That's fine. Good to know : ) Thank you for replying. Dear Pita, this looks really nice. I am thinking about starting an open source roguelike game project. Does your license allow that use? This would be a free browser based game (and open source), so I am not sure if that counts as redistributing or not. Strictly speaking, the license requires that end users aren't able to extract and use the assets outside of your project. However, if it's communicated clearly that the assets aren't free and that users need to purchase a license for themselves if they wish to use them in another/their own project I'm ok with it. But your project will never be purely open source using these assets, sorry! I really liked your style. I bought these and I am really happy to use your things Hello, I love this pack very much! Does this liscense allows me to modify some parts of these assets (add new action of charactor, change weapon , change hair color,etc) and then use the modified version on my commercial game? Yes, the license allows that! Thanks for supporting me by purchasing this pack, it helps a lot. :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>RPG Monster Pack$12</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Designed specifically to suit SRPGs , but would also suit RPGs , action RPGs, rogue-likes, etc. These characters are designed to suit environments with 16x16 pixel tiles. Package includes the following characters: Each character covers: Over 300 unique frames altogether! The tileset shown in the example images isn't included in this package. If you're interested, it's over here: RPG Dungeon Tileset Licence: GameDev Market pro licence About WONDERDOT: Hello!

If you're interested in hearing about updates/additions to these and other game assets, check out my twitter or tumblr .

You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. are the mobs in 16x16 or 24x24 pixels ? They are designed to work with 16x16 tiles. Each character fits 16x16 in their idle state, with the exception of the orc and troll which are a bit taller. During other animations they exceed 16x16 where necessary. Pita, We could really use a hero pack. Hey! I email you the other day about potentially adding onto this pack via a commission.If you're interested, please let me know! Hi^^ Will you add idle animations for sideways directions aswell? and death animations? looks weird when the enemy walks sideways and stops and transforms to look downwards I don't have plans to add these animations. The final frames in last few rows of the sheet can be used as still frames for down, left/right, and up directions. You can use these to idle left/right/up facing if you don't want characters always facing down, although they won't be animated. Hi mate, do you include the color palette for us to further develop the assets? I don't, sorry. I didn't restrict myself to a set palette when I created these resources, so the palette quickly expanded as I worked and it's not particularly organised or useful. If you wish to expand on these assets I recommend just reusing colours where possible. I believe my starting point was DawnBringer's 32 colour palette , although I used this very loosely and added/changed colours when it suited my needs. Hi! Could you tell me the size of the monsters? they are 16x16? 32x32? They are designed to work with 16x16 tiles. Each character fits 16x16 in their idle state, with the exception of the orc and troll which are a bit taller. During other animations they exceed 16x16 where necessary. Video review by John Hancock for a game using this package: is this under cc No. I have linked to the licence in the asset description. This is from Dwerve isnt it??? No, these are original assets. The Dwerve developers bought and used these in their game. Oh whoops, so sorry! I was confused. I love ur art btw, its amazing. our stuff on Itch.io is all pretty old. are you still making assets? And they're awesome assets!! Hi Pita, Your work looks great, I've buy 2 for the moment. Do you are also working on a "Heroes Bundle" too? That could be great ;) Thanks a lot! Pita, Just wanted to say I'm making my first game with your art and it's making me look like I'm a professional who actually knows what they're doing. Thanks so much for the excellent art at a very reasonable price! -Jake Try this, made with Pita's resources, Python and pygame! https://alejandroandre.itch.io/ebizaxe Pita, How exactly do the arrow animations work? The N and S animations seem to look good with the perspectives (big to small and small to big) but the E and W animations the arrow looks like it's wobbly. I am not exactly sure how they should be setup. Hi Ryan, The arrow frames aren't really designed as an animation to be played start to finish, but are rather trying to cover as many angles the arrow could be facing during flight. I would select which frame to use depending on the direction of the arrow. I failed to explain this in the package. Sorry about that. Here is a demonstration of the angles each frames is roughly trying to cover: You can pretty decently cover a variety of arcs with these frames, but for straight shots you probably only need frame 3. I'm not a great programmer by any stretch of the imagination, so it's probably for the best if I didn't give any advice on how to implement this. One thing I can recommend trying is adjusting the anchor points of each frame to the arrow head. @Pita, we are nearing the release of our game using your monster pack. We mashed up this game set with some other assets to create "Modite Adventure". Below is some gameplay footage. Interesting, it looks like an action RPG, right? To which platform is the game being released? Yes. We're releasing it for the LDK Game console. So the game I am working on (using this monster pack) is for the Atari Jaguar, and it's called "Kings of Edom" Looks like Nethack! Is it a roguelike? Hello Pita :) I like the work you did here. I also have a 16x16 pkg. Interested in a bundle in november ? Have a good day ! I am interested in more monsters of the same size, and with the same moves, as I need more different monster types for my game. Currently I have done 2 variations of the existing ones (using a different color map), e.g. Pale Orc, and Toxic Slime. maybe make more enemies , a boss or more area's Actually I am quite fine with the 16x16 size characters now, as I changed the tiles to fit the new size. Still I am wondering if you would be interested to do more monster of the same size? Here is a video of the game (on Atari Jaguar) so far: Very cool, phoboz. I love to see people developing for old consoles and want to try my hand at it one day myself. I don't want to rule out future monster packs, but it isn't a priority for me right now. If/when I make more monster packs, they'll be at the same scale as this pack so that they can be used together in the same project. Great, I hope that you will. I got the feedback from the community (Atari Age forum) that people are really looking forward to this game, as there were not many RPGs for the Atari Jaguar (only one in first person perspective) I am now using all the monsters, with all the animation frames in the game. There are enough for levels, because 4 monsters are available from start, and 2 new types appear per level. Perhaps I will reuse the existing ones, but with other colors for the stronger ones. Love how you have the forest open up into clearings. Very soon this game will be released: https://atariage.com/forums/topic/312772-announcing-a-rogue-like-rpg-for-the-ata... This is what the final game looks like: Hello Pita, I am working on a rouge-like RPG for the Atari Jaguar. I am considering this monster pack, but my current hero is 16x24 pixels. So maybe I need to change the hero because of that. Therefore I wonder if the hero is included in this pack, or do I need to get the tileset pack for that? Currently my game has other tiles, so I don't need them. Also I am wondering if you would be interested to make some more monsters, preferable a little bit taller (e.g. 16x24 pixels)? phoboz These (and your other graphics) are absolutely beautiful, thank you so much for making them! I'm currently attempting to kickstart a game which uses them. Hopefully it will be successful and I can send some of the money raised your way - as my current finances did not allow me to pay as much as I think your amazing work deserves. I love these sprites, and join the other voices hoping for another pack with more heroes and monsters! I used this pack for my first game jam , everybody liked the art more then the game itself! These are really good sprites, with very good animations too Hi Pita, very good job so I need more monster to build my game. Can I bouy other monsters? And heroes? Thank you! Great tile sets. I purchased them all. Any plans on making another pack with additional hero's and possibly another monster pack? This spritesheet is FIRE!!!! perfect for small projects! I did my first game using it https://federicojacobi.itch.io/lair-of-malice Make sure you get the Dungeon pack that goes along with this https://pita.itch.io/rpg-dungeon-tileset which is also spectacular! what is the size of the characters? 16x16 pixels mainly. The larger characters (orc, troll) stand a bit taller than that. They also extend beyond 16x16 during various animations. Hi there! I just bought this awesome pack to use as park of some web game development, but it's just occurred to me I will be hosting code / assets on GitHub, so downloading is only a right click away. I wanted to check whether this is ok or not. If not I totally, totally understand and will avoid doing this, but I thought no harm in checking! Many thanks again for the amazing art! Hi drpumpkinhead, The license doesn't allow you to let users extract and use the assets for other things, so I think there needs to be some kind of attempt to package it. BUT If that's unavoidable because of the nature of your project, I'm ok with it as long as it's clear to the users that they can't use 'em. Just include in the readme (or somewhere noticeable) 'hey these assets aren't free!' and point them in this direction! Thanks Pita! I am not aware of any way to package so its totally not accessible (but I will have a look around), I think what I might do for now is work locally but not publish and have a think over a potential solution. The project is a bit tech-demo-ey so what I might do eventually is add the text to the readme and only use 1 sprite rather than all of them, that would be enough for my purpose and then there is only one available if people decide to be naughty. Or maybe I will remove the sprites for placeholders and get people to add their own if they want to build the project (with a recommend link to your assets ofc!) Many thanks again! now we just need a boss pack and we're set. oh and maybe UI that fits the artstyle Nice Idea! Nice demo! Keep it up! My day has been made with this pack, man :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>RPG Clicker</TITLE>
<TEXT>Ludum Dare 41 Submission by Stefan Trifunovic aka Mercury It's my take on what would be like to mix and match RPG with Incremntal Clicker. Kill monsters, upgrade weapons and health talk to NPCs :D Hope you like it. It's my first ludum dare and I really liked it. So to the next ludum dare ;) LUDUM DARE 41 : https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/rpg-clicker Controls: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I do n't know why I spent so much time in <span class="EzKURWReUAB5oZgtQNkl" data-src-align="44:4" <this<="" span="">the game</span> , but here is my result . =) whats the key to start idk that one It's the 'Enter' Key great !!! bad [havent even loaded the game lol] Simple, but cute and enjoyable. Main complaint is that when you try to walk away from an NPC, a lot of the time it triggers them to talk again. This game is obviously dead, having had no updates in three years. It's a shame. It's a nice start with much potential, but a few minutes to get to 40 damage and HP leaves me wanting more. Cool, its a nice game. The game is good, however the map is too small which I kinda expected for a game that is this good that was made in a short amount of time. I do agree with some of the other comments in which there could be more hp options and there could also be more enemies. All in all, great game and if you do decide to improve the game, I would love to see where it goes. how do i dodge? I really liked it i even rated it 5 stars... there is a problem tough with hp it seems we can`t get enough.... It's a little frustrating to get down to 2 health, and have to spend 37 gold to get a single HP back. Keep the +1 HP potions cheap, add some more expensive ones that add more HP or have other special features. Would like to be able to skip the dialogue, also. As someone else said, needs a way to distinguish strong enemies from weak ones. Maybe label them with levels or make the regions more separated (like around the village, they're weak, but if I cross a bridge there's stronger ones or something). EDIT: After posting my complaint about the indistinguishable enemies, I went back in, and eventually ran into a 600 HP Mystic sitting directly in front of the village. It had wandered from the top of the map to the desert. Good game, please continue development Really love this game! Me and my younger brother played it so much we got to the point where we had 47 dmg and we were looking for an enemy. I really had a fun time with this game (and probably spent way too much time on it but hey, its fun) and I think it should be given a little more content, and then put on the app store! Again really great game! I think this is a really good base to build something more off of. I took a look at your game in a video I made about the LD game jam recently. I share the complaint that the dialogue noise being annoying. I also had some issue with the enemies that I talked about in my video, specifically how I died a bunch because I couldn't distinguish between strong and weak enemies. Overall I think it's pretty good, especially considering it was made in a weekend. Nice gfx with simple controls, and pretty fun too! Good job! However, the sound effect used for dialogues does get annoying so maybe an option to turn it off would have been nice. Nevertheless, I enjoyed playing this game very much. :) Okay then. This made me laugh. Simple but entertaining game.</TEXT>

<TITLE>RPG Overworld Tileset$12</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack A grand adventure can't be confined to single location. You need fresh air! You need to get from A to B! Let your campaign take place over a grand landscape. This tileset contains 16x16 pixel tiles for creating overworld style maps. V1.2 With this series of assets I hope to recreate the magical feeling I had while playing the classic SRPGs of old. For updates, follow on twitter . Contact: pita.madgwick@gmail.com License details In order to download this asset pack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $12 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. it doesnt have any corps or monsters? Was going to buy but not a fan of the license. Just wanted to leave the feedback. Seems very restrictive. Going over the license once more has been on my to-do list, and I'm open to feedback. Feel free to let me know what aspects you find too restrictive, or would prevent you from doing what you want, by email: pita.madgwick@gmail.com this is beautiful! would buy a bundle of all your tilesets! Is there a summary of contained sprites? I'm very interested in overworld structures (e.g. caves, dungeons, temples, castles, houses, etc) but I can only see a tower, some houses and a castle in these screenshots Structures included: 3x2 Castle (x2), Houses (x10), Fort (x2), 1x2 Tower, Hut (x3), Cave entrance (3 types, with mountain/cliff versions). Also bridges and city walls. This set is great! all it's missing is a farm tile as it looks like a medieval overworld. I just bought this and so far it is my favorite style of overworld assets that I have tried out, but is there any way to get a horizontal version of the mountains? Mountains only support the mountain ridge going vertically or diagonally, but you can string several of these together for mountains that occupy wide horizontal spaces. Fair enough, I'll see if I can figure a way to make that look good. Thank you. This is really cool, well done! Hey Pita! Great Tileset! I would like to know whether you take orders for custom Tilesets, e.g. addition of a new biome in the same style? Apologies for a very delayed response. I've just opened up space for commissions for the next month or so. If you or any others have any requests please contact me at pita.madgwick@gmail.com Thank you. I have finished the purchase. Can't I buy other resources Sorry, as I mentioned earlier I don't have any other resources on the Unity asset store. Pita! I've used this pack to make a game for uni coursework last year and I'm using it once again for my dissertation! I'm making a procedurally generated survival game and would love to know if you'll ever create a second overworld pack for snow biomes, deserts, swamps and so on? You're awesome, hope your other works are going good, dont forget about this series! ~Joe Hi Joe, Thank you for kind words! I haven't forgotten about this series, but I also don't want to make empty promises about future packs. I would recommend that you, or any other users needing extensions to the packs, treat these resources as-is and make any extensions you need by your own means. Sorry for being vague! & best of luck with your dissertation! Hi Pita thank you for the reply! I've done as you have said and made a quick palette swap to add a snowy forest environment. I'm also looking to use the mountains as the highest areas of the levels, however I am having trouble configuring them with rule tiles. Were they built will these in mind? Thanks and have a great day! The mountains weren't built with rule tiles (in Unity?) in mind, and don't follow a typical construction pattern. It may very well be possible to set them up in rule tiles, but that's out of my expertise. You can see how I go about constructing the mountains in the documentation. It may give some ideas on how to go about automating their construction. Hello, I can not pay in China. What places can I use Alipay to purchase this resource? Hello, I sell this asset on the Unity asset store here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/overworld-tileset-123120 I believe they may support Alipay. (unfortunately I don't have my other packages available on that storefront) Hi Pita, I was wondering if you could do also a snow-like version? So essentially the exact same as you have it, but with snow everywhere on trees and mountains and the grass? Frozen rivers for example as well? Just an idea :) Hello, I wanted to confirm something about the license. Would I be able to use this or your other tilesets in an online map designer. I want to allow people to make maps for Tabletop games, and I'm building a set of tools for that. But I want to make sure that the license covers this case, since I see in the license this line: "licensee may not distribute game artwork in a manner meant to enable third parties to create derivative works incorporating game artwork." This type of use is not covered by the license, sorry. Understandable! thank you for the quick reply. I bought the tileset and love it but I had a similar kind of question as dreii. For my game project, I'm building a campaign editor so players could create their own content, but the content could only be run through the game itself, not used to create a separate project that could be run on its own. The player would have to run my game, navigate the list of campaigns, and select one to run. The tiles would be compiled into my game (Monogame, so they would be xnb files) and if a player shared the campaign they created with another player, they would not distribute your tiles, their campaign data would just contain references telling my game which tiles to use when running it. Would this usage be acceptable? Thank you for reading. I admit it's a bit murky in this case! For the user-campaigns in your project, I wouldn't consider them derivative work, since it's all contained within your game. So this is fine! If the users were able to create their own independent projects using your campaign editor that they could distribute (and their own users could play without using your project), that would cross the line. For that sort of purpose, you would need a sort of distribution license, since the scope is so different and could directly conflict with my own distribution of the assets. I really appreciate the fast answer! I thought this might be the case but wanted to silence the nagging doubts before I got in too deep, haha. I'll be picking up your other tilesets too in that case! (After checking their licenses as well, of course) Thank you! oh man, I WISH these were in a 48x48 pixel tiles size also :( I'd buy this in a heartbeat !! it would be perfect for my game with how colorful and nice it looks. Hey Pita, I bought this pack and I love your work. What tool did you use to create the animated gifs? I cannot seem to create them with tiled. I can't recall the exact method I used. I think I captured the screen in Tiled using LICEcap (or some similar screen capture->gif tool), then went back and tidied them up in Aseprite. This is an amazing tileset! The documentation provided is a life-saver, which of course I didn't read immediately (regretfully). The author does everything possible to ensure these assets are used correctly - short of creating the maps for you. Thanks for providing this pack!! Hello Pita, The mountain rendering is quite impressive, how did you reach this result ? With autotiles ? Thanks :). I didn't use a standard autotile pattern as the framework to design these tiles, although I think it's possible to arrive at this solution coming from that angle. The core of this tile pattern for me is the line of the peaks running north to south (or north west to south east) that separates the lit and in-shadow areas of the mountain, and then working out from there. I didn't invent this, though. I had done some studies of the mountains used in the Fire Emblem series some years back, so I knew this structure worked quite well from that. As for rendering, I forget my exact inspirations, but I was going for a soft look with these. Three reasons: so characters can be placed on top of them and be easily readable (for SRPGs), help sell the scale, and because I liked it at the time. This comment section is already very cluttered, so forgive me if I don't go into details for rendering tips. Thanks for your complete answer, Pita :) I'll take a look at FE tileset ! Sorry this isn't the place to write it. But I saw that you had a "first person" dungeon crawler art on your Itch.io main page. Are you planning on releasing a first person dungeon crawler tile set? I've been looking to find something that fits that criteria everywhere. Hi! I bought this asset from humble bundle sometime ago and I'm trying to use it in tiled. My issue is that the wang sets are not set up and the guide doesn't explain how to set them up. Could you help me with that? Thanks Hi Aganierm. The 2-corner wang sets in this asset pack have been set up as terrains in the Tiled tileset file. Back when I created this tileset (2018! Yikes, time flies) I found it much easier to paint maps using Tiled's terrain feature over their wang set feature, and at the time it seemed to me like Tiled's wang set feature was mainly focused on flood filling maps with a variety of tiles, not what I was using them for. It can be done, though. You might find some use in setting up the 2-edge sets, like the paths and rivers, since those don't fit into Tiled's terrain feature. Personally I still find it easier to hand place these tiles. My documentation isn't specific to any program, so you won't find any help in there for setting it up. Here's a screenshot of how I just did it: https://imgur.com/a/UGoo7cH Hope that helps. Hey there, bought the asset yesterday, loving it! The only thing is: I'm using them in Unity, and I had to change the anchor point for all my tiles (sort order works better with anchor point at bottom center..), which kinda messed up some of the animated tiles on the tile palette. I can just re import them on the palette, no biggy.. except that some animated tiles assets are missing from the asset folder. Like for Ocean Deep or Shallow, I only have tiles 2, 5, 6 and 7. Ocean Beach: 1, 3, 5, 7. So I need to recreate all the missing animated tiles.. unless you have them and it's just a mistake that they're missing from the asset? Thanks! Hi! Glad you're enjoying the assets. Re: the missing animated tiles. It isn't a mistake that animations haven't been set up for those tiles, as they're simple rotations of the other tiles. Since the tile palette in unity supports rotations, I could reduce the amount of busy-work setting the tiles and animations up in Unity by omitting those. I can imagine changing the anchor points messed up the position of the rotated tiles. Best case: I think you should be able to fix it by just giving those particular tiles in the palette some position offsets? If rotating is a no-go for your project for whatever reason, unfortunate answer is that you may have to set up the animations for each of them (which was very tedious, hopefully you'll be spared that). The tiles are all there in the spritesheets folder, but I believe I only 'sliced' what was necessary, so that would be the first step. Disclaimer: I'm not a user of Unity myself, and I haven't kept up with any changes to Unity that may have happened since I created the package. There may be a better solution. Hello, Pita. I bought this tile set from Gamedevmarket and I am using it for my project. And here I met a upversion tile. Can't you provide upversion tiles on the gamedevmarket side? Do I have to purchase again here to use the upversion set? Anyway, your tileset is very nice. Thank you for making a good pack. Hi Adelie. Thanks for letting me know of this. Don't know how I missed this, but this is a mistake. I've submitted the update to Gamedevmarket. You don't have to purchase it again, the 1.2 version will be on Gamedevmarket once it passes their review system. I checked for updates. Thank you very much! I love all of your packs so much and I've used them heavily in my game! Thanks for making these available! Hi Pita! You plan to create new tilesets like RPG Village Tileset? in dungeons, desert etc? I am very interested. Doubt: This world tileset would be GIF compatible RPG Village Tileset? For use in the same game. Is this compatible with your Monster and Dungeon tileset? In the regards it will look the same thematic and size/style? Yes, they're both 16x16 pixel tiles, and designed as if they were for the same project. How long will you be on your current project before being able to accept more commisions? When you are free I would like you to consider doing a commision for me ill pay for you to continue this project and greatly expand it and will pay well. This has been what I have been looking for for quite some time. it reminds me of the early Ultima games but updated. This is gorgeous!!!! Do you plan to add Snow/desert (or any other more) themed tiles in a future? Thanks! I'd love to add more environments like that, but it's currently on the back-burner due to my other commitments. If/when I get time to work on this asset pack series, another character pack will be next up before anything like that. Thank you for replying! Just bought this Pack, and the Dungeon and monster's one (Village one is next :P) and im seriously in love with it! A character pack would be an amazing adition! Currently working in a Fire emblem like game, and the character pack would come super handy, as of right now Im taking the base hero sprite (from dungeon pack) and trying to draw over it to make it fit for other characters (I hope thats ok with you) In any case thank you so much for sharing your work! I look forward for more assets packs from you :)! I love this! It's dead-on the look I was after for my current project :D Though, any tips on the animation and unity (2018)? I can't seem to find any information in the zip file about it, basically my animations are playing way too slow. Thanks for your comment! It's been a while since I've tinkered from Unity, but from memory there are couple different places you can affect animation speeds for tiles. Easiest way is to adjust the animation frame rate of the entire tilemap (just double check your tiles are on the correct tilemap if it doesn't appear to change anything). You can also change the frame duration of the animated tiles one by one.. Could be a bit tortuous that way but possible. Here's a video showing the two different ways: https://youtu.be/6JXAAsVIVbs?t=324 I'm not a unity expert by any means, so hopefully that helps! minor fix for Linux/ Mac with case sensitive files: rename `guideImages` to `guideimages` Woops! Thanks for letting me know. Is it compatible with RPG MAKER MV out of the box? No, it isn't. Sorry! I need to refresh my memory on what needs to be done, but due to RPG Maker MV's restrictions I think it will need quite a bit of editing to work. It is easy to adapt, actually! The problem is with me. I don't know how to configure tilesets, unfortunately. You have done a nice job with this one, BTW! It would fit perfectly to the game we are doing, though. Your guide.html file is awesome great job! Thank you everyone for the nice comments. :> Amazing had to grab this! I also wanted to thank you, I really appreciate your technical guides and example files, incredibly useful Such a great style! So excited that this is out! Beautiful work.</TEXT>

Hi Pita :> I love(x100) your asset. Would it be weird to 32 x 32 the size of your design? I don't want to touch your sophisticated art, but I can't help it to meet the specifications of my game. (Sob sob) I can't find anything I like more than your art! You're the best! Hi Pita, I'd love to make a game with all of your assets but there isn't quite enough for a polished game. Do you have plans to release more sometime soon? Thanks! Hi pita, I am just starting (a few weeks now) with pixel art and I really like your style and cute drawing technique... Do you have a specific color palette that you use? Because I cannot figure out a nice combination of colors. When I do it, it is either way too saturated or too dark... Kind Regards. I don't have a specific palette, and I'm afraid I don't have a great method for selecting one. You might have better luck posting your work to a website like Pixel Joint or Pixelation.org for specific critique on what you're working on (or to just discuss pixel art in general). I'm probably not the person to ask since I never had the patience to study colour at depth. My sense of colour has been slow to develop and what I know has just been slowly absorbed over many years (and I still have much to learn!) Thank you Hello Pita. I've previously bought all three packs in this set and I love the style. It's very unique and has a ton of charm. I'm wondering though, do you plan to expand on this and create more sets in the same style any time soon? And/or, do you perhaps take commissions and if so, what are your rates? Best, Leo Hi BearNovels, Thanks for your support and kind comments. New packs are a low priority for me right now as I have my hands full on other things. That may change at any moment, but for now I have no plans for a new pack any time soon. Similarly, as of writing this post, I'm not available for taking on commissions. No problem. Thanks you for your quick reply. Doesnt Dwerve have the same art? How many types of outdoor trees are there? It says in the License, " Licensee may not superficially modify the game artwork and sell it to others for consumption, reproduction or re-sale." Does this mean I can modify it and use it in my game only? Or can I not modify it at all? You can modify for the purpose of your project, correct. You just can't edit and then re-sell the artwork itself. I mentioned this on your dungeon set, but is there any chance this will be available with a Unity tilemap scene? I'd pay extra for that if necessary. The description mentions autotile, is it 16-tile or 48-tile autotile format? 16 tiles. Terrains cover the 16 tiles described here: 2-corner Wang Tiles Walls, fences, hedges use these 16 tiles: 2-edge Wang Tiles Hey! I just bought this pack, great work! :) I noticed that it doesnt have any water tiles - do you have any suggestion where I can find some that would fit the style, is the "Overworld tileset" compatible? Cheers! The water tiles from the overworld tileset won't be compatible straight away. However, with some small tweaks to the grass colour, they could fit fairly easily. It wouldn't be perfect -- that tileset was a drawn to a different scale than these so there are some minor style differences -- but I think they could do the job. hello. what is the size of sprites ? The tiles are 16*16 pixels. you need ground tiles that have shadows where the house meets the ground(for the front of the houses). there was one other comment months ago mentioning how the houses looked chopped off at the bottom, the lack of shadows here is why. other than that this set is perfect. even without this fix, I'll be buying this set, but it would be nice to have. you created shadows on the front sides of the house roofs - this is exactly what's needed except on the grass/dirt infront of houses. should be relatively easy to create some shadow sprites for use in Tiled that go on their own shadow layer, so there doesn't have to be any modification to other tiles, and we can throw the shadows on the right places. Should basically be three shadow tiles, two corner/edge tiles and a middle tile. Thanks for clarifying that earlier comment, not sure how I got down the track I was on and see the issue he was describing straight away now. I don't have plans to amend this set at the moment. I agree that the bottom edge of the house tiles could use some more breaking up so it isn't so jarring, although I wouldn't personally use the solution you described. Still, you're welcome to make any edits to the set as you see fit. Thanks again! Can I use this for my commercial project? I'm making a game. It can be used for commercial projects, yes. I've been watching these packs for a while, and noticed these packs have never gone on sale. Is there any chance so I can pick them all up? Also another character pack would be amazing. ^_^ should the bottoms of the houses be cut off so harshly? i feel like theres a bottom edge missing from the housing. Not sure if I understand you correctly, but the height of the walls (minus house upper layer) is deliberately one 16 pixel tile high -- decided early on that'd be a part of this style and tried to stay consistent with that. I can understand how some people would prefer taller walls that overlap characters a bit, and that would actually be easier to draw as you don't have to break perspective/geometry to fit stuff in as much, but I'm sticking with how it is in this series. I didn't understand you correctly, whoops! Not sure how I misinterpreted that. I don't have plans for making adjustments at the moment. Sorry this part of the tileset bothers you! I had already purchased last summer, the Dungeon Tileset and Monster Pack... I sent Pita requesting a few extra packs that I had ideas for, and he knocked this one out, this Village Tileset. This is just as awesome as those. My game will be released soon, and then I will be looking to do a sequel, and will have to purchase those again for that. I will use this purchase for my sequel along with the others. Thanks, Pita p.s. Any thoughts on my other requested items? [Bosses, Items, Monster Pack 2, NPC's, Undead Pack] Thanks for this comment! I don't want to make any promises regarding future packs, but I definitely would like to add more characters at some point. Hi Pita do you have any color palette for the set? They're very nice and I wanna use them for my short game. There aren't any colour restrictions for this asset pack, so the palette is quite... expansive, haha. I don't think it would be very useful at its current monstrous stage (you may as well be picking from the basic colour picker in your image editor at this point). If you like the colours I'd treat it like a non-pixel art image and find the colours you like and try to mimic it. Thanks very much for this tileset, I've been testing it out and making some small tweaks. Looking forward to more graphics from this series :) Very nice ! I love it My game ll use houses with walls being 2 tiles high (32). There is any suggestion or tips to build them? Or its easy like the tutorial 2 tile high walls are possible with this set. The tutorial covers this very lightly (just some example pictures - check the 2+ story section). But I recommend looking closely at the example scene (blue roof building) to see how these tiles can be used like that. Wonderful job on these! I like it very much. I bought the image you painted. Do you want to draw other furniture icons? I need your furniture image !! Thank you very much for purchasing! I enjoyed drawing the furniture a lot! I will be adding more furniture to future tilesets, but the next tileset will probably be more outdoor areas... it could be a while away! Now you are developing your game as a resource! So you need a lot of resources to draw. I'm looking forward to your good resource. Seu lindo voce Ã© muito bom! make a 32x32 version pleaseee Creating a 32x32 version would best be done starting from scratch, so I don't have any plans to do this, sorry! Love ur art Style! just loved the roofs I ll buy the set and make some ajustments to fit my project! Is the roof too big for the short house ? Hi! It can fit buildings as small as 2x4 tiles (including walls). 5x4 tiles if you actually want to fit a door on it. Does that answer your question? (not sure if I understood correctly) I assume he just meant visually, i.e. the roof overlay looks too big for the frame of the interior.. but that's a just a matter of perspective! :P Either way, this pack looks amazing and I had to buy it. I am loving this series and have bought all of your assets, what do you have in mind for the next release? I made sure the projection is all consistent (although sometimes design / tile efficiency takes preference over that). I think what may be throwing it off for him is that the walls (under layer) are already 'sliced' quite low so that they take up exactly 1 tile without overlap. The roof tiles are not only just adding the roof, but also draw the rest of the wall that has been hidden. Had to do it like this for it to fit with other existing tiles (like the door frames). I would like to do another outdoors tileset (with cliffs, water, a variety of trees, and maybe farm-related things) before I move on to other settings. I won't decide for sure just yet though. Awesome, I am looking forward to your next release! As a paying customer and loving fan I would 100% vote for this. Especially if the next tileset is also compatible with this one and the dungeon tileset. There are so many artists on Itch that do a little bit of this and a little bit of that - making it very hard to make a game with say an inside AND an outside (who'd do such a thing?!?!?!). The other thing that might be nice with these three sets is to draw more objects / enemies, girl characters... Either way well done. You've done another spectacular job :) Thanks for this comment! Next tileset will definitely be compatible. I've been wanting to do another character pack for a long time, so that might come first (and will include female heroes for sure).</TEXT>

<TITLE>Proximity Compass plugin for RPG Maker MV$7.19-10%</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool This is a RPG Maker MV plugin that adds a compass to the map screen, marking the position of nearby events and the directions of far away events. Events are represented by icons from the icon set. This can be used to help the player locate objectives, points of interests, NPCs, and more. The sample project download for this will include the following: The main plugin itself along with some supporting plugins. The popular Yanfly Options Core plugin will also have settings pre-configured for the Compass options. The elegant compass frame picture that is shown in the video above! This will be included in the sample project's img/pictures/ folder. Pre-configured plugin parameters that will be used to make the compass look the way it does in the video above! Examples created in pre-made maps to help those who learn visually or hands-on. There are the two quests included in the sample project that are shown in the video above, too! And last but not least, pre-made icons at the bottom of the icon sheet to show off the utility of the proximity compass. Default Show: Show the compass by default on the screen. This is the system setting for the game. The player setting will bypass this if the player chooses to hide the compass. Default Proximity: This is the default proximity range for icons to show up on the compass (otherwise, they fade away). This is the distance in tiles and not pixels. Make this as a high number if you want icons to always show. Player Icon: This is the default icon used to indicate the player's position at the center of the compass. X Center, Y Center: These settings are the code used to determine the center coordinates of the compass. Radius: This is the radius (in pixels) for the compass from the center. This will be adjusted for if the player decides to change the Compass Size. Tile Scale: The scale used to calculate the distance of a tile relative to the distance on the compass. Back Color: The color used for the back of the compass. Compass Frame: The picture used for the compass' frame. This will come from the img/pictures/ folder. An image will be provided in the sample project. Compass Fade Speed: Fade speed of the compass when toggled on/off. Lower is slower. Higher is faster. Icon Fade Speed: Fade speed of the icons when out of range. Lower is slower. Higher is faster. Hide During Messages: Gives option to hide during message events. Does not apply when the player is simply performing movement actions or receiving items. Hide During Events: Gives option to hide during any event except parallel events. This is more wide covered than Hide During Messages. Show Compass: Text in options menu to show the compass. Compass Size: Text in the options menu to change the compass size. To add a compass icon to an event, make a comment in the event list and add these comment tags: This plugin is made for RPG Maker MV versions 1.6.1 and below. If you update RPG Maker MV past that and this plugin breaks, I am NOT responsible for it. This plugin is compatible with the following plugins: Yanfly - YEP Options Core Place this plugin under those in the Plugin Manager list. Otherwise, I cannot guarantee this plugin will work as intended. I am NOT responsible for the compatibility of the plugins not shown in the above list. 1. These plugins may be used in free or commercial games. 2. 'Fallen Angel Olivia' must be given credit in your games. 3. You are allowed to edit the code. 4. Do NOT change the filename, parameters, and information of the plugin. 5. You are NOT allowed to redistribute these Plugins. 6. You may NOT take code for your own released Plugins.

A lot of the icons are just a color change.

Design is making choices . I'm not here to tell you which ones to make, but I do want you to know why you're making them. This download contains PDFs for screen reading, home printing and DIY booklet printing. It's available in print through my website for $5 ( click here for that ) - if you'd like it in print and find that cover price a barrier, you can also request a free print copy from the zine library.

<TITLE>RPG Slasher</TITLE>
<TEXT> RPG Slasher is a mixture of classic Top-Down-RPG and side-scrolling Hack'n'Slash. You go on an adventure, fight and slash enemies, level up, upgrade your equipment and slash! I still hope you have fun with this. Controls: Arrow keys : Moving Space : Action/Attack Q : Take Potion ESC : Back/Cancel It's my submission to the LOWREZJAM 2019 . I also combined it with the A Game By Its Cover 2019 . This is the cover I choosed. It's from Jaime Ugarte . I wanted to use the same pastel color palette which turned out to be pretty challenging when you mix it with just 64x64 pixels. So I also added a light and a dark tone to every color. It is just a very early prototype. There were many more things and features planned, but as you know, you always run out of time :P I was in such a hurry, that I forgot to integrate some main functions, like game over. LOWREZJAM ended before the Game By Its Cover, so I didn't touched the game since. But there will definitely be a post-jam version with fixed bugs, a proper game over, an endboss , some NPCs and a lil upgrade system. Hope you still enjoy my game :) Thank you for playing ã¾(ï¿£â½ï¿£)~ Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Just found out how to counter attack. I still am alive even know I have no health left. Anyways great concept, I give it 9.21/10 best game ever 10/10 I have never hated catussesseses(cacti) more SO MANY ENEMIES ENEMIES ALSO HAVE BUGS I CANT DIE THE ROCK DUDE LAGGED NOW I CANT GET OUT OF THE BATTLE try counterattacking pretty fun but a few flaws Shhh, don't tell! They might fix it! (Or at LEAST add 'no way to block flying projectiles') love the fighting system :) but too many enemies appearing fun when the sand guy gets stuck in the air you can bounce off him and attack him but that gives you a little boost up and i ended up outside of the screen so i had to reload the game and you cant die but other then that good game -the stupid sand idiot is always in the air -you can't die -some things will go to the bottom of the bar and not die -encounters too frequently 7/10 oh, and one more, at the end, a random encounter happens with the normal music and puts you back in the middle Holy moly! What an amazing game! Awesome music, nice graphics, overall great experience! Keep up the good work! sometimes enemy wont go down also the intro paper airplane can break a window wow why is there a lot of glitches bug report: i can't died enemy floated at air won't come down dead enemy can still deal damage to me enemy encounter too frequent, like every 3 seconds, wtf? Game look great, but the code seems to have some bugs. I ABOLUTELY love the graphic details though <3</TEXT>

If not, I was considering trying a dual grid system.. look it up on youtube Your material No.1 I really hope you can make some other materials. arms items gemstone Such RPG items is there a tutorial ï¼ After months looking for it , now im a happy owner of the pack.. did buy the last bundle.. dunno if is there a place to review the entire thng or if i should to to every part of it commenting the same thing :') Once i was skeptical about the quality but damn :) Impressive Damn, this is some gorgeous art friend! Do you use a public color palette? I bought "Winter Sale 2021 RPGW" AssetBundle. The only unfortunate thing is that the tile composition is the same as what you see on the page. The map layout shown as a usage example does not appear to be included. If I have to look at the assets and create from the floor to that example, the work time increases a lot. Even if it is a tiled or png file, it would be good if there is an example to follow. Please come in to Szadi art. Discord Community Server. https://discord.gg/SACgN3htEr Just purchased the bundle and your assets look amazing. Some of the best pixel art I've run across. Absolutely stunning! Great work and Thank you! Thank you, I try to do best i can. I am also learning how to improve my work all the time. Im interested in buyng the bundle with the discount but reading the previous comments made on all of his work makes me not to buy it.. Its an amazing work and i really want it but im afraid to get a different thing. Is there anyone that did buy it that could tell me if after buying you got what you paid for? Thanks in advane and sorry for my bad english Rather unrealistic that you will not get the purchased asset. With this someone it is probably some kind of mistake you write about. Well, maybe im too worried about cuz i used to buy things in other places and had a big problem, not everytime.. yet, my bad, i might have focused on 'worried' reviews instead good ones.. Im thinking to buy one to see it will make me happy and then, the 20$ one (complete one) Im curious, if i buy one set and then i want the complete one for 20$ , i'll need to pay 20$ for all of it, right? i wont consider that i did buy a part of it, already. just to be sure :) Thanks in advance this artist does good work and wonât cheat you, I own plenty of these assets and never had any issues. New here and just bought the RPG bundle; thanks for the current discount. Though I was hoping to actually have cut tiles in single files available and not just one big file. Also the animations are only the keyframes as PNG, I was hoping to have animated gifs. Am I missing something? I want to use them in a browser based game, so it will take a lot of time to cut the tiles myself and animate the trees... Come in to Szadi art. Discord Community Server. Did that, no one there it seems ;) Anyway I found this nice plugin for paint.net together with the PSD plugin to open the file, I was able to autocut the tiles; just need to sort out the "empty" ones: https://forums.getpaint.net/topic/27216-image-tiling-filetype-2021-01-23/ In twenty-something years of game development, I have never seen anyone use tiles as individual files. Using a single tile sheet/tile atlas comes with tremendous opportunities for optimization. In the end, you want to create efficiently laid-out texture pages with all of your tiles and sprites. You then reference the UV coordinates of the sprite/tile(s) on the texture page when you need to draw one. This minimizes costly file operations, unnecessary texture page swaps, and much more than I can realistically cover in a quick comment. If you're using a game engine, it almost certainly supports tile maps/tile atlases with some kind of native functionality. If you're drawing to the canvas manually, you should still be using this fundamental approach to implementing tile systems. It's been refined over many years by many intelligent developers. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps Please know, I'm not trying to shame you; we all start somewhere. My point is two-fold: 1) If you're asking for separate files for each tile, you aren't working optimally. In fact, very much the opposite. 2) It's an unreasonable expectation to put on the creator of this asset. No one else is going to need individual files, not if they know what they're doing. So you're asking for a lot of tedious work, at no extra cost, for something only you require. I genuinely hope this was helpful. Forgive me, but everyone learns, one can do that better, the other that better, but check the new version of the Grass Land v2.0. Regards. You might have misunderstood me. I was supporting your work and your methodology. My comment was directed at the other poster. Oh, I see. Somehow, I must have replied to your comment by mistake. I meant to reply to his. Sorry about the confusion. Yeah, it's cool that you go through the trouble to meet people's requests, but I was just pointing out that asking you to break your tilesheet down into individual files for each tile is requesting too much work for no additional cost. We got it wrong, Sorry for the problem. Second thing, since you spend so much game development, you should know that long ago strategies and simple platformers were built on autotilling. For rpg games, you have always hand-built graphics, my approach is a bit different. But if you visit my discord server, you would find out that I am trying to modify my resources for people. Would it be possible to add tree stumps for each of the trees? Would be super helpful for games where you can cut down trees. Before I purchase, just wanted to ask if it's okay to modify them to my liking for my game? After I buy the pack of course. Yes. Can you also use it to auto tile in Godot? I don't think so. I tried everything and out of the box it doesn't match the pattern in godot. The assets in the main folder does not match the assets shown here, you have to go into the unity project package to get those files. Are there plans to create more of the RPG Worlds tilesets? Maybe a desert one, a fire/lava area one, etc? Yes. But when? When i finish one of my comission work. hello, @Szadi! I'm one of your itch io followers. I had a bit of a request for your tilesets on itch io. could you release 48x48 versions of them for devs who use the RPG Maker MV/MZ game engines? I noticed the largest sizes you have is 32x32. if you could do add a 48x48 tileset size option too, that would really help me out a lot. I really love your art by the way. very pretty and vivid for pixel art. Thanks! ~ "Kurochan" from KuroyukiDev Games Also, I sent you a friend request in Discord a moment ago. I'd love to chat with you about game design and game art if you're cool with that. ÐÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°Ñ ÑÐ°Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ° â¥ I just purchased this really nice set; love it! I do notice that on two of the promo images there is a cobblestone path. I do not see it in the artwork I received. It would be nice to have! (hopefully this is just me not seeing it) Nvm! Found it. I think there is a mistake? Top rightcorner of Main_Lev_build. The transition from light grass to water got the wrong grass color. It should be light grass to water and not dark grass to water? Yes, I will try to fix it as soon as possible. Thank you for catching an error. Decided to take the plunge and buy the entire Rpg World set to show my support and hopefully make a game with them. Packs are very nice, but might take some work to get them to work in Rpg Maker. Would love to see some snow areas or more town details/shops. If you made a base city pack in the RPG Worlds style, it would look so amazing! Just purchased your set and I am looking forward to your future releases! Thank you! I am loving how the RPG worlds are shaping up; however, there are only 3 of them to make a complete game. Are you working on towns or dungeons? I'm working on caves, but when i'm done i don't know. I have a lot of other work not related to drawing. No worries, life keeps us busy. I'll be picking these packs up; I just wanted to make sure the graphic set wasn't abandoned (it happens a lot). Great work though! ^_^ Gorgeous! Es bellÃ­simo! Can you please confirm if any animations exist? If not, can you please add some, particularly with water? Otherwise, looks nice. Sorry but no animation yet, if there will a lot interest of this asset, I will try to add something. Fair enough. If you do add animations, I will go ahead and make a purchase. The graphics certainly look nice.</TEXT>

I'm having trouble getting the Dialogue Boxes to scale properly without looking weird in Unity, however. 9-slicing them doesn't produce the result like you show in your first gif at the top of this page. Any advice on how to achieve that look? Should add that I'm specifically struggling to make the area for the speaker name to scale in a way that's appealing while 9-slicing. Lmk if you need more info! Dear Hector, under what kind of license do you sell this asset pack? I would love to use it in my game. :) Thanks in advance for answering! hey! You can use it for personal and commercial use. Don't worry about that! Thank you very much! Of course gonna credit you and send you a free copy when I'm done! :) you are welcome! I will wait for those copy hehe Hello! I really love this pack! it fits my game perfectly. I did re-arranged the position of the sprites (and fixed a few little things) so i could import them without problems with the unity slicer, if you want to upload them for people to use I don't mind sending them to you! Thank you again for this pack! :) Can you send this to me ik its a little late lo Looks nice, would be better if it was already in individual pieces instead of a sprite sheet. Also really need a higher res version, this is way too low res to use in my game. Impossible to use as a menu at 1920x1080. You can always use Shoe Box an Adobe Air program that will slice everything up for you. How? I use 16x16 textures and it even looks nice on a 4k screen. Hi, does the font support glyphs/accents for french and german languages? Thanks i love the character Some nice window GUIs. May buy later... the UI png can't be auto sliced in unity, any fix? You can slice it with 16x16 size and 8x8 for the mouse icons :) well maybe next time try to leave some transparency between sprites so that the auto slicer can work. The current format is very user unfriendly. Very good !! Do you have any plans to update additional ui elements in the future update? if you think I can improve the pack tell me what do you think it need and I can try to make it :) This is amazing, also where's the character in the pictures from? The Red Ridinghood with axe its mine (but not included because its unfinished and old work) Aw I see, love the style!</TEXT>

Great stuff Looks good and I just bought it to test it with autotiling. Unfortunately I don't understand this format of autotiling. Otherwise I would buy the rest as well. Sitting now for 4 hours in vain and have no plan how to connect. You better add for what you made this. I want to create my own games, but it's kinda hard to find assets that fit together. Your art is impressive and I hope to see more from RPG-Worlds. Just downloaded everything you created and I'm gonna buy everything you add. Thanks dude! :) It is nice to find 32x32 tilesets of high quality. I do have a point of concern; will you be making a variety of packs in "Rpg Worlds" format to allow developers to make a full game? Yes, I'm going to create so much more, other levels, props (animated and static) and more. Your stuff is so cool! Can't wait to see more quality art like this :)</TEXT>

It's just amazing, I'm just in a great mood. Your game is very soulful and real, I returned to my childhood, thank you for your efforts. Thank you for your support, it is very important for me. First off let me say that I like the concept and what you have done in the game so far. But there are a few things that definitely need to be fixed for it to be a good game. 1): The controls need to be fixed, the virtual joystick gets stuck constantly and its placement is bad, it should be in the lower left corner of screen honestly. 2): There are no descriptions or names for any weapon/armor/item in game. All the armor looks identical so when you pick up another helmet say, you don't know which one you're equipping because they arent labeled plus you have no clue what they do (there isn't even an armor/defense statistic...). It appears that there is only one type of each article of equipment, which if that's the case then obviously alot more should be added as thats most of the fun of playing a roguelike rpg is finding lots of random equipment. 3): You can attack and be attacked through solid walls, so hit detection needs to be tweaked 4): You find these altars that say "donate 100 gold...etc" but there is no option to actually do so that I could find 5): The home button needs to be repositioned to the top left corner of screen as twice I accidentally hit it trying to open a menu and reset my game. Those are the things I've found so far, as I said I do really like the concept and I think this could be a really fun game if those things are corrected. If I find any more things I think should be changed/added I'll p out another comment later. Keep up the good work. Thank you very much friend, I will definitely do as you say, I am sure it will be very good. Thank you for your support, it is very important to me.</TEXT>

I wish other packs like this one are coming :) love it ! Many sprites and animations are missing! Mini mushroom sitting (right/left/top), fish stack, bottles, water's objects animation, broken house and etc some tiles are missing. Like the axe. love this pack and colors. Hey, in your pack have the tilesets (2).png file? Awesome pack. Wich font did you used on UI elements? Hey, in your pack have the tilesets (2).png file? Hi again! I wanted to share with you the progress I've made with this asset pack. Brookhaven Instagram Great work love what youâve done with the asset pack, look forward to seeing what u do in the future Do you take commissions? Small commissions - like single characters? So much stuff! Also, the quality is amazing. Thank you for sharing. Hope you'll keep updating it!^^ Can't wait to see more. A tavern would be a really nice addition. Hi, really nice work. Can I use it in my commercial project? I will put your name in artist for sure. And if I need anything customized, are you able to help me do some contractor job? All my assets are free to use commercially and credit is not necessary but much appreciated. As for contract work my email is warren_clark86@hotmail.com weâre we can talk further. I love your style, this asset is awesome. I want to know if u are planning to create more enemies to update this pack or create a new one Really nice art works, love the style. Fit perfectly for my game. OMG can't believe how much stuff is in this asset. Its awesome! ð Love your stuff and use them again :) https://play8bitars.itch.io/its-dark-bob Hi. Love your style. Does this tileset include interiors for the buildings? Nice style, but this asset is very unorganized... Some assets have background colors and you have to remove it to use it on different layers (potions, flowers, fences etc...) Some tilesets are just stitched togheter. I'd really like it if was created with more modularity in mind (same tileset organization for autumn etc.) I absolutely love this pack. Do you have any interior tilesets that go along with this by chance? Edit: Also, whenever you're available for commissions I'd really like to order some more art. Thank you!! Are the goblins from the Curse of Acadia twitter also included in this pack? I really liked them Just bought it, looks awesome! Do you plan to expand upon on it and update it? Or release another asset pack in a similar style? Definitely would buy sets in similar style. Thankyou for the purchase and at the moment im just added files from my canceled projects, no plans to create new assets as of yet. What is the tile size? 32 or 16? Very nice art, you certainly have a great eye for design. I'll definitely buy this if they fit my game size. Thx! All tilemaps are 16 x 16 if you whant to join me you can and we will make a powerfull games can i make a game with those asset because i am a gameDev and i am pro in programing game Can this set of resources be used commercially? Are there any restrictions on the development engine? All these assets are free to use commercially in your own game, just not to be sold as assets as they are. Okay thank you! I wish you a happy life! these packs are amazing do you take commissions would like two more dungeons tile sets water one would be awesome breakable pots treasure chest Cheers and I do take commissions but Iâm full up at the moment, Iâll be posting on my twitter when Iâm free again This is awesome! I'm already plotting a game idea with these and had a question... in the UI, it says quest and map as a sidebar but doesn't appear to have the UI for either of those... Any idea when those will be released? Thankyou, look forward to seeing what you can do with it and unfortunately this is all the ui i got finished in this project, maybe in the future but nothing planned right now. Ah okay... by chance do you take commissions? Your work is incredible! i do but im full up at the moment my twitter is @WoostarsPixels ill post when im free on there Thanks for releasing this !

You can check it out here: https://mikitahancharou.itch.io/charons-duty Really appreciate your work! Hi, Szadi art. I'm fan of your art, and now I'm working on making game with the art in the bundle. for this one, I guess it's missing the opening parts of the cave, the ones with grass. If it's true, can you upload the part as well? Download again other Assets, all RPGW have entering to caves. Oh I see. Thanks! Got all those nice looking themes in a bundle, having some isssues working with them though. Somehow hard for me to understand what is what. Only thing I would change is provide some example pictures within those packages. Hi Szadi art! Just purchased this tileset (the whole bundle actually), great work, I love it! If you don't mind, one suggestion here - could you please add some Blocked Entrances to the set? Seems pretty important for any kind of cave system. Thank you! I second this. While I bought this in a bundle, so I have doors in other tilesets, some kind of blocking material that fits the tileset would be interesting I'm glad to see you making new environments, because you only had one before so I couldn't do anything with it ... now I can! yes, would love to see some city and castle stuff :) Also, thank you kindly for all you do, you are appreciated. Keep on dude, love your stuff! nice tiles as always, city tiles with house and inner house tiles next please.</TEXT>

Loving your work, just bought this one, and a couple more on unity asset store, any plans on making a tavern/pub asset pack? It's a great art. I bought it, but is it okay if I modify it slightly to fit my game? yes thanks! Any plans on a 48x48 tile size version of this set? Do you plan on adding any animations to this winter pack? Love the RPGWorlds set but the winter areas feel a bit "frozen." Great artwork btw! very talented. The assets appearing "frozen" seems quite appropriate to a winter pack :P I love all of your art! One issue is, making auto tiles with these assets are really hard. I know it'd will be too much to ask for, but would be really nice if there were some premade ruletiles, or slice the tiles so that it's easy to make one I love Szadi art ! Me 2!</TEXT>

I'm new to game development and recently purchased your RPG Overworld Tileset. Iâd love to create maps with it, but I think it might take me quite some time. Would it be possible for you to share the TMX file of this map? It would be a huge help in understanding how to structure my own maps. Thanks in advance for your time! Hi, I'm not sure the TMX would help you as a this point it's a mess of me pasting the new tiles over the top of every time I update the tile set! I also tend to do everything by hand instead of using the auto-tiling and probability features in Tiled, although the tileset is designed to let you use these features. In future updates I'll look at including some templates to make getting started easier. In the meantime I can give you a break down of how I go about building up maps though. I pick a base biome depending on what the most common terrain type will be for the map - usually grass or wasteland. Other biomes are added on top in separate layers, they're designed so they can overlap each other in different ways. If I'm using the multilayer tiles then water is usually the top biome layer because the shore tiles can overlap all the other terrain types. Then I add layers as needed for smaller details like trees, roads and rivers, structures and mountains. For the single layer version of the tiles, you can build this up on a single layer or use multiple layers for easier editing and flatten at the end. If you want to use auto-tiling there's a reference image showing how the tiles map to Tiled's corner based auto-tiling algorithm. There's many different ways of doing this depending on what works best for you. For the multilayer tiles I usually make a terrain set where the edge of the biomes transition against a "null" or empty tile and fill the biome layer with this null tile so I can draw in the shape of the biome on top of this. Then for "sub-biomes" (e.g the lighter grass, trees on the single tile layers, cobble stone or paving) I have these transition against the base terrain type so I can draw these in on the same layer. Trees can autotile, but mountains are placed by hand and have a repeating pattern (this is another thing I'm looking at making easier to use in future updates). The tile set isn't designed to allow for transitions between more than two terrain types in a terrain set as it would be unworkably large. I hope this helps you get up and running! - Matt Hi Matt, thanks for your support. I've created my own maps. They look good to me, but I still don't know how to animate the waves. Can you advise me on which tiles to use for that? Here is my maps. this may sound like a basic question, but i am struggling to understand what the "flower"ish tiles are supposed to represent? in your example images, they look like they're being used in towns. are they roads / paths? what's the difference between the ones with shadows and without? If we're thinking of the same tiles the ones with shadows are cobbles and the ones without shadows are paving. Hope this helps! I am having the most trouble figuring out tiled map editor and getting the terrain brush sets created and working correctly. Is there one already created for the latest release or maybe something that can help me figure out how to create them? I'm trying to do a 4 layer design of... background of grass, Then water, then landTypes, then doodads. Hi, I don't have a Tiled implementation for the current version of the tileset. I'm in the process of putting together an update to make it much easier to use the tileset with autotiling systems and specifically for use with Tiled and I'm aiming to have this finished by early January at the latest. The third image on this post shows how terrain tiles in the update will map to Tiled's edge based auto-tiling: https://mattwalkden.itch.io/rpg-overworld-tileset/devlog/800175/update-on-the-up... The current version of the tileset is missing inside corner edges but is designed to allow you to substitute solid terrain tiles for these and it contains versions of all the other tiles needed to create an edge tile set. I hope this helps out a little in the meantime. Sounds good! Looking forward to it. I got time. Until then, Keep up the great work! Hands down the best overworld tileset that i've found so far. I love literally every tile! Are there rules for maps? I don't know how to tile them quickly. They use a mix of edge and corner based connections at the moment. They're designed to work with multiple layers (I usually have a grass layer for the base, a water layer, a layer for other biome types and then a layer for trees + buildings and other features). I've got an update on the way which I'll aim to get finished before the end of the year which will re-work the ground tiles and trees to work with most corner based auto-tiling algorithms as well as composite tiles for single layer editors. I'd hoped to have it finished by now, but it's not long off! I come here every week for the update ð«£ your map is genius and you can build beautiful worlds with it. Just the tiling needs some adjustments and based on your dev logs they seem to get fixed. Any way I could support you more then just buying the tileset? I am working on a medival multiplayer trading game based mainly on the world map. Right now I use a test map to figure out functions but more and more I see how I like creating really beautiful scenes on the map and make the world come alive. If I could wish for something it would be some production buildings like wood cutting camps, mines, smith and maybe a town square. Otherwise ofc. A RPG Overworld character set with civilian / non battle units (In comparison to your Fantasy Battle Pack) great tile set keep on going! The update is coming soon, I promise! All that's left is to animate some new water tile variants and do some checking to make sure everything tiles correctly. I'm aiming to get it finished by the end of the year / early January at the latest. Feedback and checking out the updates and new asset packs whenever they roll really helps out, and it's always nice to hear what people are up to with the assets. Production buildings would make a nice addition, I'd have to think about how to implement them though... As for civilian / non-battle units in the style of the Fantasy Battle Pack, In the short term I was planning a small update to the free asset pack with mounted units but long term other asset packs with units / characters in the same style is one of the ideas I've been kicking around - but nothing concrete on that yet... Is there a diagonal shore line? A checker board shape of Water and Shoreline? There's an inside and an outside corner to the shoreline, so you can create a 2 tile thick diagonal line with those. I'm not sure what you mean by checkerboard, but the tileset doesn't allow for alternating land-sea-land-sea tiles. It would be land-shore-sea-shore-land-shore-sea-shore. Hopefully that makes sense! Yeah, I didn't see anything quite like what I was looking for. For instance, if north east and south west are land, and north west and south east are water. Just curious, but what engines can I use this for? I have RPGMZ. The tiles are in a .PNG image format and are 16x16 pixels in size so they should work with the vast majority of engines. RPGMZ supports 16x16 tiles in .PNG format so you should be fine. Oh, cool! I don't plan on doing this in the immediate future, I've been leaving implementation up to users. I am currently working on an update to make the tileset easier to use with auto tiling algorithms though. Any news on the progress of the auto tiling update? :) It's still on it's way, I've ended up adding alternate tiles for terrain edges which has led to me needing to animate extra variations of water tiles etc. I've reworked the trees for auto tiling as well. The end result is you'll have the option for much more organic looking landscapes but still in keeping with the current clean style. It's a subtle change but it makes a big difference and I'm really happy with the results. I'll do a dev blog post previewing all this when I'm at the stage of polishing up and doing consistency checks. My current plan is to have the update out some time in September. Hi Matt - these are really clean, beautiful tiles. I love your modern-retro style! Thanks Zane! Hello, can this be used in commercial steam game after purchase? Hi. Yes the assets can be used in commercial projects. The full license agreement is included in the zip file. Your tilesets are so beautiful, I had to buy your bundle, please keep it up! I'll be following your updates <3 Hello! I like the graphics. Do you have any plans to add lava area graphics? I thought it would go well with the world map graphics. Hey! My next planned update is going to be to tweaking and reformatting the tileset to make it easier to use with auto-tiling algorithms but after that I want to add more features and biome types and a lava biome would be cool...! This is such a beautiful tileset! Just wanted to ask, did you already release the Ruins and Settlements update? If not, would I have access to it once it's released if I buy the tileset now? Thanks! The Ruins and Settlements update is still on its way. If you buy now you get access to all future updates (there's other stuff planned for the future but I really need to get Ruins and Settlements finished before I start talking about any of that!). Is there a setup for Tiled available for this? I would also like to know. There isn't a Tiled setup included currently but the tiles will work with corner based auto tiling. I'm planning on optimising the tileset and including variant versions for edge and corner based auto-tiling methods in a future update to make creating your own setups easier. I've just kinda dabbled into Tiled recently. do yo by any chance have the Tiled setup for it or even still by any chance? I'm having so much trouble ;\ Hey, I don't have a Tiled set-up but I'm working on an update to make implementing your own much easier: https://mattwalkden.itch.io/rpg-overworld-tileset/devlog/800175/update-on-the-up... . The update has taken longer than I'd expected but it's almost done, I just have to animate some new water tile variants. As well as fixing the existing tiles for auto-tiling and restructuring the tile set for easier general use I'm going to put together an alternate version of the tile-set for single layer editors. So all this is coming soon (the next month or so) but in the meantime with the existing tiles the best way I've found to work in Tiled is to have a base layer for grass, a layer for biomes (wasteland, snow, desert, sea etc.), a layer for sub-biomes (long grass, deep snow, deep water etc), and a layer for other features (mountains, buildings, trees). You can use multiple extra layers to overlay different elements too for more variety and more organic looking maps. Don't suppose you know, or if anyone knows any unit/creature assets that would work with these sprites? I have a free asset pack available with some unit graphics that you might find useful: https://mattwalkden.itch.io/fantasy-battle-pack Thanks, these are a great start. Beautiful set. Would like to see more done with the legacy tileset as I'm targeting low end systems. Even if you programmatically generate them and use a lot of space I can pick and choose what I need. Definitely will be watching for more assets and updates from you! Thanks! I've got a small update in the works to add ruins, new buildings and farm land. Once that's out of the way I've got plans to address some formatting and tile arrangement issues and I can look at the legacy tile set as part of that. In the meantime you can always overlay tiles and export them in any image editor that supports layers and produce your own merged tiles that way. is that update canceled? Hi, the update isn't cancelled, I've been busy with other work but it's still on the way (along with the other asset packs I've got in the works). - Matt Hi, I'm trying to make some assets using your tileset's colors. Is there a certain color palette you used? I love your tileset by the way :) Thanks! I didn't use a set palette, just picked colours for what I needed as I went along. I tried to keep the colour count down but there's probably some very close colour choices that could be optimised here and there. Is this compatible with RPG maker? curious if auto tiles are possible and animations, etc Hey, sorry for the late reply. The tiles are 16x16 pixels in size and (I think) RPG maker is locked to 48x48 pixel tiles, so you could blow up the tiles to three times the size with an image editor if you don't mind having big, chunky pixels. - Matt Could we have some documentation for bitmasking the set? Hi, There's a folder in the zip file called "NoAlpha" which has versions of all the tileset layouts without alpha blending, just fully opaque or fully transparent pixels. You can use these to make a bitmask by filling in the transparent pixels with your 0 value colour and all the solid pixels with your 1 value colour (or the other way round, depending on how you're doing things). The shadows that are designed to be drawn with transparency have the RGB value #664d8b (102,77,139), so if you're doing alpha blending through bitmasking you can fill all these pixels with whatever value of greyscale you want depending on how transparent you want the shadows to be (I used 0.37 in the tileset). Hope this helps. - Matt This is a Masterpiece! This pack is insane, I haven't worked with it yet but I looked at the tileset and I'm super stoked. I needed a overworld map that was versatile but this seems to be really insane. Thank you so much for making this. Worth the asking price!!! EDIT: I am now working with it and it's soooo goood. I'm so happy with this. Again, thanks a ton, the versatility is just insane. Amazing work! So cool! I love the animation Hi got a question. Do you require to be credited for any use of this tileset? If so then i'm really sorry because I released a game demo without crediting the tileset. Could try to take down the demo if that makes it better. Emphasis on try. Hey, no credit needed. Can I get a link to the demo? I'm always interested in seeing what happens to my assets out in the real world! Took down the download a little quickly then but dont worry I'll message when the demo get's put back up, and thanks for answering. Was really scared there for a bit. thanks for adding more biomes looks great ! I've a question, if I buy this, is the tiles 'straight'? On the screenshot they are a bit tilted but I guess that is to prevent copying? The tiles are straight in a standard 16x16 grid. You're right, the tilting is just to prevent copying! This looks great just purchased it! Please add more biomes to this world. Its a great start! i would buy it, but i miss swamps,canyons,tundra and jungles biomes. And an higher variation of mountains and plants for each biome. Many Gamemasters would kill for an complete Overworld Asset pack to visualise their Overworld in Tabletop RPGs. Should probably commision him to make that then. Adding new biomes isn't something I've ruled out but my immediate plans are to add some options for modern buildings. Out of interest how useful would a hex based version be for tabletop RPG maps? for hex based assets we all use http://dgbaumgart.com/works/painterly-game-tiles-hexes/ stuff because it has an high variation and he is working on new stuff right now. If you make more biomes (which I would also like) then publish them as a separate pack, assuming the price is similar I'd be happy to pay for more of them! :) frankly I don't even use hexes for regional maps in TTRPGs, I prefer square tile grids for both battlemaps and overworld maps. Beautiful! Reminds me of Ogre Battle. Yeah March of the Black Queen, got the same feeling! :) Wow! Looks great! Thanks! This is beautiful, the more I look at it, the more I fall in love. I had to purchase this straight away! Also just bought your arcade pack and I already own your font pack. Great work, really looking forward to see what else you release :D Thanks, I channelled a lot of happy gaming memories in to this. GBA era Advance Wars and Fire Emblem, Warlords on the Amiga, SNES era Final Fantasy etc.</TEXT>

Love to see where this game is going: An Itchio RPG for learning Japanese | Tatami Road p1 https://youtu.be/cEhUame-ABw Hey! Just watched your play through! This was amazing! Thank you very much! I am really glad you enjoyed the game. Keeps up my enthusiasm >< Just finished the demo. I was so surprised by how long it went on for, every time I was sure it would end there was still more, an incredibly generous demo (or maybe I'm just slow...) I love the approach this game has to teaching so much, I've been studying Japanese with duolingo for about a year and while it's a very useful app for practice, I felt like it never really taught me grammar rules properly. This game does a really great job of pacing learning and practice, with easy to understand explanations spaced between lots of chances to practice what you've learnt. The story is immediately a really interesting one, I think it's very common for language games to place you as an outsider looking in, so it's a refreshing angle to play as someone trying to regain their own language, not learn a new one. It's a very sad concept to lose your native tongue, but a hopeful journey to learn it all again, so it has a kinda bittersweet hopeful feeling, and grounding the lessons you're learning in a personal narrative like this is a great way to help you remember what you're learning, I think giving an emotional context to something is a great memory tool. I did run into a few problems with the game, both with glitches and design. I played it in English, and in quite a few places the text that was supposed to be in English was in Spanish instead. For the most part, I was able to figure out what it was asking of me fairly easily based on context, but it did cause some confusion sometimes. I'm unsure if this is just the English translation being incomplete or a glitch confusing the two builds of the game or something. I also had a game breaking bug where, when I was exploring the first outdoor section, I walked past some cones on the right, accidentally walked into an out of bounds area and couldn't get back into the world. Luckily I had saved fairly recently so I could just reload an old save, and I'm not sure whether that's a replicable glitch or a rare occurrence. In terms of design, when I started up I was a bit unsure where to look when I was asked to check my books, it took me a while to get my head around the interface of the phone, that may just be me, but maybe a clearer explanation could be helpful. I also had difficulty knowing how I was meant to space my sentences when typing questions/answers. I've only ever typed Japanese without spaces, so I sometimes found it a bit tricky knowing whether I was supposed to write, for example, "ãã±ããã®ãä¸­ã«"ãorã"ãã±ããã®ä¸­ã«". I do get that encouraging people to use spaces before they start learning kanji will make it easier for them to break up the different parts of the sentence in their head, but maybe allowing them to enter both options with and without spaces/in kanji or in hiragana could help reduce some frustration of not knowing what you're doing wrong. The most difficulty I had was with when you had to ask how to say a word in English, e.g "ãããã¿ãã¼ã©ãã¯ããããã§ããªãã¨ãããã¾ããã"ãThe problem I had was it took me ages to realise I was supposed to include theããand spent ages thinking I had done something wrong with how I spaced the rest of the sentence. Maybe either allowing people to type the answer both with or without theããcould make this a bit easier, or maybe explaining at some point that you need to use them? The only other problem I had is I thought having to redo the quiz in the library if you got even one answer wrong was a bit harsh, especially cause most of the mistakes I made were with spacing not with the grammar itself. Everything else worked for me I think, and I hope they're problems that were either specific to me or can be easily fixed. I'm really excited to see where this project goes, I think it's an incredibly helpful resource and it's already helped me to get a much better understanding of grammar, so I'd love to see what happens when it moves onto some more complex sentence structures, as well as whether Morita and Tanaka will be able to regain their language. Wishing you all the luck with development, and hoping you manage to get some more eyes on this really cool game! ãCarinamãthank you very much for this interesting and constructive comment. I took note of many things you said and for sure will be present in my mind while developing the game. I am sorry for any bug encountered during gameplay. Bugs is one of the reasons I want to migrate into web based development. In this way I will have much more control over the code. Lets keep in touch! Sorry for the late reply! I'm so happy that it was helpful~ And no need to apologise, bugs are unavoidable part of development, especially on a small scale indie project where you don't have access to QA testing Love your game so far! I've played it for like an hour an 15 minutes, on my way to the library. I'll post my review here once I edit it. hi! I tried to open it on max but I got this error: The application âGameâ canât be opened. Is it still possible to play? Looking forward to it! Hi! Sorry for this late reply. This is a peculiar season, isn't it? It should be possible to still play! But what do you mean by "open it on max". sorry! I meant on my mac computer. maxgraze, thanks for your reply... I will try to replicate this error and let you know once I found out how to solve the issue. On the other hand, now I am working on making the game web based. But this will take me some. Stay tuned! I like your game btw Hey! Thanks for checking it out! I used RPGMMV and lots of great plugins that are around there. so you didnt code for this project? i thought rpgmaker was a codeless way to do it You can script and make your own plugins or modify (if available) other's plugins yo!</TEXT>

I was interested in using these for a game in an online forum, but you said you cannot upload or share them anywhere else. Would I be able to use individual icons in the forum game? It would require me to upload certain sprites to am image hosting site. I was interested in using the tools and general items for the most part. It's a non commercial pokemon roleplaying fan site! Yes you can. What I mean by upload is directly sharing the actual files (like in a folder) for other people to download. Using the files on a website is completely fine. Thanks! <3 Love the icon set! you should add a music toggle as well as sound on your packages. Eles crescem tÃ£o rÃ¡pido. gostei do seu pack, depois quando eu for fazer a parte dos icones eu dou uma olhada melhor, parabens!!</TEXT>

You can use my work with Photoshop, yes :) I'm planning to expand the Asset Alliance collaboration project instead. I have a question about my Summer Sale purchase on the Unity Asset Store... how may I reach out to you? Here ? What's the problem mate I had bought the assets from the unity store, but had difficulty even using since I was unaware of how the unity asset store worked... I use RPG Maker, but I can't seem to access it without having to open it through the unity program? I was looking at the home page link to purchase the Summer Bundle, but I thought it could be linked to my itch.io account. The unity program gives my computer difficulty ... that it hangs before I can even access it... since the assets are not directly downloadable as png or image files? The advertisement on the link does not instantly mention it being only for unity? But only assume that you can buy it off the unity store? ... I did not know that the underlying disclaimer of buying off the Unity Asset Store will give me such a difficulty... so I'm wondering how you can help me access the files, if I cannot run unity at all? ... I had bought it a few hours ago... before the summer sale is ending. Hoping for your assistance! Thank you I'm sorry you had a bad experience with Unity. However : don't worry, ianov, I'll help you with that when I come back home tonight or tomorrow :) You'll be able to use RPG Maker with it ! ok! Thank you! I have the same issue. Please help me too. Thanks. I want to ask also. I like how the original tileset is orginazied, but I found that it's not as complete as legacy. Why are they made different? Oki, just send me a mail at xxxxx with your unity store receipt âºï¸. For the record : lecagy tilepalette was the only palette in the v1 of the unity asset pack. The current tilepalette came around the v2 and is, in my opinion, better organized (as you said), but some assets didn't make there (obscolete tiles). You can use both, it's why the legacy is still available ðð Gif's pack is excellent, and is mostly compatible with other similar pixel tilesets, is easy to edit when needed, and I love the character designs. As someone who has trouble creating smaller RPG characters from scratch, I've learned a lot from these. Buy his all in one pack, totally worth it! Gif, thanks for the awesome work! Can't wait to see it expand in future and buy more packs. <3 Oh, thank you very much ! I like this art style, but I'm already using elv games (farming game, rogue adventure, fantansy dreamland). Is there some automated way to make the color palette of the two compatible? [programmer here, not artist; okay with things that involve scripting] Hello! Sorry to bother, but I just had a quick question. I was able to use your godot autotiles to set up most of the ground autotiles, but I'm struggling with the water. Did you have any tips or anything you could point me to to set up your animated water autotiles in godot? Thank you. Hello, I have completed the payment. Could you please pack a PNG file separately for me? Thank you very much! compasscc1431@gmail.com Hello, I'd like to purchase a complete set of documents. Is there a PSD file in it? Because I'm not very good with unity software. Hello :) I provide every files in .PNG image format, so you can use them in any game-engine. If you work in Unity, I have made a dedicated package (with better assets integration) here : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-rpg-topdown-tilesets-pixelart-assets-full-bundle-212921 Gif, I cannot find a way to reach you directly, I have a game I have been developing for the last 8 months and it is really far along. I intend to do a full release on as many platforms as I can. One thing I am struggling with is coming up with a car sprite. In an area of the map there is a city, where cars (stationary and not drivable) are a core point. I have been able to create a bunch of sprites akin to the style of this pack in supplement to the ones I have purchased so that they fit with the theme, but a car has proven to be very difficult for me. Is there by chance anyway you could connect with me about this? Thank you brother! My email is realktnmusic@gmail.com Hello! Can I ask where are the river's tiles? I couldn't find it hey Arastii, May I ask you what tile specifically ? Are you talking about a tile you saw in one of the screenshot maybe ? Yes, that's right Hello! Your assets are really well-made, you did and awesome job! I curious about the license, can you please explain what is an "IA project"? You mean feeding a generative AI model, right? Is that ok if the game uses AI for the enemies' behavior? Is that ok if I use generative AI to help me develop the game, like generating code, or dialogs, or even the story? Is that ok if I use other assets generated by AI? I am sorry for asking this much questions, that's the first time I see such a license, it's very new to me. Hey yuri, Yes I don't want ppl to feed an AI model with my assets. You are fine using my assets in your project âºï¸ð Thanks so much for clarifying, hope you have a nice day! Thanks, you too ! Hi GIF. All good? I love your packs, I think everything is very beautiful, you are very talented :) I have a question, I am developing a game with Godot 4 and I need the content in a PNG file. As I'm Brazilian, it's easier for me to buy through Steam than directly through this website here. If I buy through Steam, will I have access to the content in PNG so I can use it in Godot 4? Hey mate I'm fine, thx :) My Steam packages are only a subset of all of my collection, and they are scaled (x2 and x3) to match rpg maker requirements. So it's not super easy to use them in another engine. I can send you downloads keys for the itchio assets if you prefer (plain .png files). Just send me a mail at pixelart<dot>asset<at>gmail<dot>com Hello! I'm wondering if all of the asset packs in the Super Retro World are using one and the same color palette, or if there are several? I'm currently researching the possibility to tweak the colors in a smooth way "world-wide" when it comes to asset pack "worlds", and would like to know if I would need to do changes in only one color palette for the entirety of Super Retro World , or in several. Thanks in advance! Hey :) I'm using the same palette in every pack, with sometimes in-between colors for some sprites when I'm out of options. You'll find the palette in most of the atlas.png files ð Thank you so much for the very fast answer! That's very helpful to know. All the best Mawleen good luck with your project ! hello am game dev i need to asset pack for RBG game So the bundle you have all of it works with rpg maker mz? sorry if im repeating a question here My assets are indeed prepared for rpg maker MZ :) If you encounter any issue, let me know ! no bro so does all your packs work on godot 4? Yes since these assets are just .png files. Do you need 3x3 autotiles ? Here (animated and single frame) : Where in the zip are these tiles? I purchased the bundle but can not find these images. Hi, there does not seem to be a godot_autotile for the darker grass or for the cliffs? Oops, maybe a mistake on my side. I'm focusing of exporting my assets to Godot v3 and v4 these days, so I'll update this package once I'm done :). Thanks for replying, I'm really enjoying these assets. Looking forward to the updates. Great asset pack! I've purchased your bundle and used it to create the following game with it: https://hollander94.itch.io/dungeons-of-elements It was a pleasure working with your assets! Is the autotiles folder supposed to be empty? hey spiritjoi :) I'll take a look at that next week ! Prob a mistake I've made After inspection : it's an error on my side during the packaging. You are not missing any content since it just the autotiles rearanged in another standard format. Should be fixed this week :) Awesome looking sets. I got the full collection in hopes of building out my MMO prototype with it. How did you do the winding river in the first image though? The only water edge assets I see have right angles. Did you hack it with half tile layering, or are there diagonal water assets I am missing? Hi Bonywa :) Thanks ! Regarding the river : yes, this is not tiled based. I have used the assets and cut some tiles in thinner slices to give the piece a more natural look. Thank you for this cute tileset! Would it be possible to request another tree variation, or two? I love your pixel art but would like to see your take on some flowering trees (crepe myrtle, cherry blossoms, or magnolia) Hello moots4 :) Oki, I'm noting this for a future update ! Has anyone gotten some of these tilesets working on Godot 4's Terrain system? Hey, regardt, please see my reply here : How to use Godot autotiles feature Are godot autotiles compatible with godot 4? Good question, I'll experiment this week and update packages accordingly ð Hey there! Any luck with this? :) Oh mb, friend, I didn't check yet. I note that for tomorow Hi :) Here are my steps : PAINFUL ! I'll see what I can do to make it easier, but it will certainly require Godot to first release an Assets Store so I could package and deliver the autotiles myself :) PS : this video helps me with the setup : Tilemap and Autotile in 5 minutes | Tiles/Pattern/Terrains in Godot 4 - YouTube I appreciate the helpful response! Thank you for taking the time, I greatly appreciate it! :) ð¥°ð I just finished a 2D topdown RPG Unity course. I've had a story for a RPG for a while now. Was looking around for a complete Tileset for complete world building. Found this, and am so happy!!! So many assets and all in the same style, ultra win!! Can't wait to start using!! Have fun ð¥° ! Well, I'm sorry if you feel that way regarding the full bundle. Grass is (mostly) light green and should match many scenarios. Do you mind sharing the tiles you are talking about ? Maybe I missing the point. Hey there, I got the whole collection to fool around with in RPG Maker MV. I love the art style, and I think you did a great job (: Sorry if this is a silly question, but I'm not even sure how to google this because I'm very new... but how do you get the imported assets to "shift" along a tile so they are slightly "higher" or "lower"? For example, this is a sample screenshot from your interior pack, and I noticed the pots behind the counter, and the items on the table: For reference, here's a table with your assets in my personal project: My question is, is this an RPG Maker setting/function I don't yet know about? Or a matter of perhaps manually modifying the assets on my end? Or is this just a constraint of using RPG Maker and I have to deal with it? Hope you can point me in the right direction. Any help is appreciated. Thanks! hey rmegali :) RPG Maker comes will a lot of constraints, indeed (one of them is being stuck within the tile grid). So you'll need to edit the tileset directly in a separated image editor software and shift the tiles you want thereð Good luck with your project ! Got it, thanks for the quick reply! I bought the whole pack but cannot find the cool portal looking thing from the samples. Also the waves the other guy mentioned. Can you please update the packs with these assets? Hello Yourking77 ! They are not animated tho, do you want an animated one ? The RPG asset tileset overworld pack (Super Retro World by Gif) by Gif (itch.io) got some animated beach water tiles (not exactly the same). If you want I can send you the tiles directly so you don't have to pay the whole pack for it. No that is okay thank you very much! and okay that is why I missed it I skipped the legacy tile folder and only searched the MV folders. I bought the whole bundle so I have all of your released assets and am very pleased with them thus far! Had over like 10k png files to pour through so please excuse me for not seeing it. Thanks so much I will look for the portals now and report back if I have any trouble finding it. Edit: Okay I got it, it is packed in a zip and it is in the atlas so I definately would not have found that without your help thank you! On a seperate note could I please request a giant tree tileset? I could use it in your awesome style of graphics to go with my game and I am sure that is a common enough theme that I am not alone. Sure, do you have a reference so I can go in the right direction ? No not really, I am not an artist so I have a hard time imagining it. I can adjust my game to whatever creative vison you decide to go with if you decide to make it but let me tell you what details I did have in mind. I imagined the trees in my game more like outside tree houses hanging from a big tree like some sort of fairy type thing so all natural looking wood and stuff, definately lots of leaves and stuff hiding it from veiw from the ground, maybe go inside the trunk of the tree every once in a while. Again if you decide to follow up on my request thank you so much! Go with whatever vision you can picture that you think would sell well for others as well I don't want to waste your time with something just for me as I can't really afford to pay an arm and a leg here so I'd hate to waste your time with something nobody else will want :) I'll give it a try and let you know in a few days :) hey mate, I'm working on it and should have a first version this weekend. This will come as a separate package with tiles to build custom giant tree (similar to https://finalbossblues.itch.io/giant-tree, but with additionnal stuff) (free for you) What game engine are you using btw ? Rpgmaker mv ? Hi there, 2 questions. I can seem to find these grass cliffs anywhere, can you hope me locate them? Are the waves for the beach animated? I can't find these anywhere either. This reference image was included in your screenshots Hey Marty :) Beach tiles are not animated, but the Overworld pack got some animated water beach tiles if you want. I can send you the tiles or give you a download key if you want to take a look. Grass cliff is a legacy tile I've removed in the past. I'll add it back to this pack later today (under legacy/legacy_tiles.zip) Hey! Thanks for getting back to me. No need for a product key I have the overworld pack too thanks. Looking forward to the cliffs. Thanks! Hello, I am going to be honest that it is not the best feeling for someone who bought ALL of your packs (mostly for support since i did not need them at the time but they were beautiful), now that I actually need to use them in Unity I am being forced to re-buy them on that platform. Action point: Please upload the .unitypackage file you uploaded to the unity store as an additional download option to all the itch.io assets. You don't need any unity keys or anything else you mentioned in other comments for this. Hello c-karaolis, Well, the content you buy from itchio can be used in any game engine, even Unity. I have packaged a version for the Unity Assets Store but it's the same assets to begin with. I can take a look for an additional download option, yeah :) Hi, thank you very much for considering the additional download options. Mostly is for the assumed convenience of setting up the tilemaps with autotiles and such things that I always find so hard to set up on my own. Yes I am artistically impaired and its not your fault. Your assets are amazing so thank you for creating them and sharing them with us! Hi Gif, I really like your tiles and art. I bought the complete collection on itch and I was wondering if there was any way for you to send me the auto tiles. Any way that you could would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! So glad I got the complete package, never been so instantly captivated and enthralled by an asset pack - you see the phrase "enough to build your entire game" thrown around a lot and I'd grant that to a few but this collection is the true embodiment of that. Not only that but the quality of art is incredible everything looks ridiculously good, seriously - thank you for making this available. The Demo is gorgeous too, does a great job of showcasing the assets and gave me some great inspiration. Hi, Seriously an insane job i bought the full pack but i have a question all have 16X16 32X32 and 48X48 Except the Exterior pack. Is there a reason or will it be available someday? Thanx Alot Hey mate, Thanks ! Oh, that is right. It's because this package, along some others (with free and paid version) are packaged with a specific script. I've forgot to include a scaled version of the atlas in those. Do you need it ? that would be awsome in 32x 32 First off I want to say I love the pack, I got the bundle, it is easily one of my favorites. Secondly I am using Unity to make a game with it, which I just now saw the pack for this in unity itself. I was wondering if I needed to purchase it a second time to get the integration to make it more easily used with Unity. The last question is if you have the palette for these, I want to make more assets for my game but want them to match the palette. Sadly color matching like that is not something I am good at. Hello Karinth :) Thanks you ! Regarding your questions : 1/ itch.io and Unity are 2 separate bundles indeed. It is way better to use the Unity bundle if you are using this engine, mostly because of the autotile integration, tilepalettes and the all-in-one assets included. Unfortunately I have run out of download keys for the Unity package (12 a year only), but I can send you some cash back if you mail me your Paypal (my mail is pixelart[dot]asset[at]gmail[dot]com) 2/ If I'm not mistaken, the color palette is present in most of the global atlas.png files (one for each package). Let me know if you find it (it's right next to each title section) : peace Thank you so much for the reply. I will just buy it again, or upload it a different way since I do not use Paypal. I also feel dumb for not seeing the palette. Thank you again! Anytime, mate :) hi, i bought this pack a bit ago and saw in the screenshots that there is an old cliff texture that looks to be made out of dirt instead of rocks, and i can't find it anywhere in the pack and i also cannot figure out how to download an older version of the pack. Do you still have this asset laying around? if so, i would really like a copy! Hello laugexd, Thank you for you support ! Indeed I have updated this asset long time ago. I'll make a update version soon with a dirt cliff :) do you have any plans to make some tool buildings like Furnaces or Forges? Oh that's a good idea, noted for this month ! I am learning to make games currently and am very new so maybe I am just looking at it wrong. I bought the 50$ bundle and I am trying to use Game Maker Studio 2 and it looks like the tiles needed for their auto tiling is not in these auto tile sets. Am I looking at it wrong or does GMS2 do auto tiling different? I think you are fine overall, but I didn't prepared autotiles for Game Maker Studio 2. I can take a look at that this weekend to generate a bunch of them :). Its alright I ended up going back to RPG maker MV cause its just more my jam lol but that would be cool for other people Love your work, I just purchased the whole bundle! Do you happen to have the tilesets in 32x32? Hello mpackes :) Thank you for your support ! Tiles are 16x16 in size by default. However, They are scaled up for rpgmaker softwares : Let me know if it's ok for you ð That works, Thank you and keep up the good work! Hello bgrizzmayne :) Right now (on itchio) autotiles are shipped for rpg maker, indeed. Maybe those I did for the Unity version will fit your needs. Any @ mail ? thanks gif : ) my @ is bgrace11890@gmail.com I've purchased the entire Super Retro World Set (let me know if i need to provide an itch receipt to you). The versions you did for Unity will work with TileD I think. Not sure how animated tiles will work, so if you had the frames laid out separate, that'd be awesome. (kinda like the time fantasy set) Something like the below, but with animated separated. If not, I might be able to convert the ones from RPG maker and lay it out by hand in Photoshop. Thanks again : D Hello! I've purchased your assets, looks great. I would really need the Unity version autotiles, can you send them to me? My email is degregori.guglielmo@gmail.com Thanks in advance! Hello konditorei :) I'll try to make it happend if I have download keys available Hello, I purchased the pack (on Unity asset store). I really like it, I was wondering if you plan to add animation to the water tile that you use in your forest example? I really like the river tiles but they are static atm. Thanks. Please keep up the good work. Hello liolyne :) Okidac I'm adding that on my todo list ! However it probably won't be through autotiles since those are limited to 1 tile large (here 16x16) where the water you mention is bigger (32x32 I believe ?). So I'll draw frames on a spritesheet you'll need to split and animate yourself (much like character sheet you know) ð Cool ! No worries about auto tile (I prefer manual tiling instead of auto tile for a more organic result and not the same repeated square shape) For the animation part, I can split the sprite sheet and add it to the palette myself. I could probably done a sprite sheet myself but I really do suck at pixel art for now :) Also really like the tile of the river border not going into straight line, if ever you do add those to the asset pack, would be great but I have asked too much already and really appreciate your work. Here's the spritesheet of a 48x48 4 frames animation of the water tile you've mentionned : it's a ping-pong animation : I'll add it for my next Unity update but you can already play with it :) That looks amazing. I don't know if there is compression on the images on itchi.io so I might wait for the next update. Thanks for the quick work ! Really appreciated:) Okidac :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Hi all! This pack contain a pixel art character for a 16x16 top down game like a rpg or survival. the pack contain: A character whit 4 differents hair color. contain the front and back character animations: - Idle ( idle whit axe, pickaxe and sword ) - Run ( Run whit axe, pickaxe and sword ) - cutting tree - mining - 2 attacks animations - death ( Death whit axe, pickaxe and sword ) New addition: - animations whit fishing rod ( idle, run, throwing, idle fishing, fish bite the line, struggling whit fish and catching the fish). - animation of climbing ladder. I separate the 4 characters in 4 folder and make the gif and spritesheet of all animations. I include a folder whit shadow spritesheets, i want to include in te gif too, but i could not. And the editable aseprite file whit the animations. enjoy! In order to download this asset pack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $3 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Can you make please a version of that characters with various weapons (magic book, magic scepter, gun, machine-gun, laser gun, longsword and invoke)? I will buy that sprites Hi, I'm interested in your work and like it a lot. I'd like to contact you privately for character design for the game I'm working on, what is your email? Thanks! Are you planning on updating the version on GameDev Market with the fishing and ladder climbing? I bought your stuff on there. If I have to buy this one again I guess I will, but I figured I'd ask first. Your work is awesome! Ooh yeah, I'm sorry. forget to update the post, in a few minutes it will be updated. Thank you ! Its really Awesome.Just hope it will work well in my project >~< I guess you partially answered this for up/down, but I was wondering if you could create a ladder climb animation? Hello. I will try to make that animation, could you show me a picture of your tileset ladder? I created a ladder that I think will work with the side view, but haven't had time to test it in my game yet. I will attempt to make the regular ladder and get back to you. Here's a rough ladder rendition with character. Looks like I may need to expand the ladder by like 2 pixels (1 on each side) to fit the character. The closest image I could find was using the attack animation, let me know if I should make the adjustments. Thanks. okay, I will try to make that animation, I will update this post when I finish it. thanks. Here's a larger ladder version, I tried to align the character better, not perfect, hope it helps. Thanks hi! Check the climb_ladder.png in the characters folders I bought it via the Humble Bundle asset bundle. Any way you could make four directional sprites? Up, down left and right? I tried to make the directions to the left and right but it did not come out, the animations came out somewhat rough, and I decided to leave it like that, similar to an isometric view. I'm sorry buddy. any way I can get the rough drafts of them? my email is markchapman.fin@gmail.com The down sprite is really all that is missing for four directions, I can make an up down left and right work with what you have done so far. You can make a free assets ? pls??? Hello, I am preparing some assets and I will put them for free here in itch, maybe this weekend I am finishing it and upload it. Greetings. I really like your style... however, I'd probably need a few more animations to make it usable for a project. So, how many facing directions are there? Good work so far! Hello, thanks for your comment, I appreciate that you like my work. All animations have the front and back as seen in the image of the character with yellow hair, except the fishing one that only has the front, I'm working on the back view Really well made! Hope you keep on doing this amazing work! Would like to have a fishing rod animation tho, but other than that, great job! Hi! thank you very much, i will made that fishing animation, i will update the post when I finish it. I love you style and your assets ^^ need more, have you already thought about creating a Patreon account? I'd happily send you $5 a month for you to develop assets in this style. hi! thanks for your comment, i appreciate you like my work. I never thought of creating a patreon account, I am not very active in the networks and I would not know what to upload. I have thought of making more characters and enemies like this, if you have any request you can tell me in the comments, I will do my best to make good animations It be lovely to see a couple of enemies in your style. It be nice to see enemies like bats, wolves, mushrooms or plants. Another idea would be some sorts of traps. Just an idea. :) yeah, I know! Maybe in the future I will bring some of those enemies to itch. thanks for the comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>RPG asset tileset dungeon crawler pack (Super Retro World by Gif)In bundle</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable RPG dungeon pack âï¸ You can : â You can NOT : Credit appreciated ! Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. âIAâ Project? Oops, I mean AI (for Artifical Intelligence) My bad, I'll fix that soon on all pages . Why does the asset description say "Credit appreciated!", which implies an optional credit, while the LICENSE.txt inside the asset pack mandatorily forces the user to give credit? That's confusing. Do as you want, I don't mind if you prefer not to. I'll update the license in the future to reflect this. excellent work !! I like it <3 Hi Gif, could you please create a GameMaker Studio 2 version of your textures? It often happens to me that I encounter packs that aren't compatible with how GameMaker 2 handles them. The reason GML isn't good with textures like yours is that it interprets the first tile as an empty tile, which can be annoying to fix in big packs like yours. P.S. I would be happy if you had a GML pack like those for Unity and Godot. hey mate, okidoki I'll try to take a look at it later this week. Hey Gif , thanks! That will help a lot. I'm currently waiting to buy the full assets pack. I will buy it when you make the GML version. where can i check when you updated it Hey mate sry I was not able to work on it last week. I try this week and reply here so you'll get a notification when it's rdy :) Hey WaterAxolotlStudio Most of my assets will be compatible with GM Studio 2 (single tiles) but there is indeed some work to do around the autotiles. Here is what I have made (autotiles format to match the GM template with 47 variations) : I didn't managed the animated autotiles yet, but if you want to check above work, just send me a mail at pixelart<dot>asset<at>gmail<dot>com and I'll send you the files :) hi sorry for the late replay i just work on my project thank you very much cant wait to buy the assets pack when i get my money Ok I'll update my assets soon with these autotiles for GameMaker. I can send you download keys for free, don't worry about it (just send me a mail) âºï¸ð Great asset pack! I've purchased your bundle and used it to create the following game with it: https://hollander94.itch.io/dungeons-of-elements It was a pleasure working with your assets! Hello I bought all your packs :) but I can't find the green water and waterfall In which pack is it included ? Thank you! I think waterfalls are located in godot/ folder of this current pack (dungeon-pack) and in rpgmaker/ folder. I'll check this weekend and fix it if necessary ð Thank you ! I am looking for the green water with wave animation Hello Gif, any news ? oh my bad, pimox, I'll check that tomorow morning :) Hi pimox, Your tiles are located here : Is it ok for you ? Let me know Hello Gif, looks like I dont have the latest dungeon pack, I'm using godot and in dungeon-pack-full-version/godot_autotiles/ I only have anim_autotile_0/4/15/23/31 I'll check if there is an update I missed somewhere :) Thanks Hi giff, I love the new cover image you've put on your profile. The gem that appears in the following image is it possible that it is not in the unity assetstore pack? Thank you, good day. Thanks, RpgItch ! (it's still a wip tho) Oh, you are right, this is an additionnal free icon sheet I have somewhere else. Here, take it : sheet 1 (set of icons) sheet 2 (set of gems) sheet 3 (rotating coin) I'll add in on the Unity package soon too :) hello! I have three questions... The first is if the bundle sold in the Unity store is the combination of all your packs in one? The second is if I purchase your assets, will I be able to use them commercially? The third is if I can use these assets in unity for game creation. Hey Ricardo ! Let me answer that : 1. Yes, the Unity package is the combinaison of everything (+ tilepalettes with autotiles integration) 2. Yes ! 3. Yes ! Have fun :) CC-BY4 pointed in metadata allows redistribution and even reselling so your metadata and description aren't synced... Oh, will check that this weekend, thanks ! So many of these tiles are incomplete and in a random order. They would be great if they were better organised and I didn't have to fix the gaps myself. As it is now half of them aren't even usable. Could you elaborate ? Sure, take this for instance ( from the fire dungeon pack ). There's 4 duplicates here, the 4 corners. Why? Not only is this confusing, but I have to edit this and rearrange it to make it usable. Here is the fixed version that I had to edit myself But to make things stranger, you have it correctly in other places. Like here in the winter pack That's how it should be, but why didn't you have the lava like that? However that is a minor issue in comparison to the tilesets with missing tiles, which are many. For instance, what's wrong with this picture? This is missing edge tiles, side tiles, and has a duplicate lower right corner in the upper left. In the upper right it has a center tile which is not even used with this style of tileset. And there are MANY examples of this type of thing. Howabout this one ( from water dungeon I think ) What the heck is this? This doesn't even make sense. All I can tell is it's animated. I have no idea how to use that. Inconsistency and missing tiles are the problem with these tilesets. Imagine your a programmer and you're sifting through these graphics and the patterns keep changing or you keep finding missing stuff. So you've got to hand edit things to make things work. Very frustrating. Haan, thats because I'm stupid : I have mixed multiple autotiles formats in the same atlas.png (including RPG Maker autotile format). I'm noting your feedback and will fix it soon (fire, nature and water packs mostly), thanks ! Alright thanks, also it would be great to have the entire set without duplicates. I bought a bunch of different sets and have to eliminate a lot of duplicate tiles while I piece together a large tileset. Yeah I understand, these things take time but I'll considere ! Hi great pack. I was wondering how to use the godot autotiles? I'm using version 4.x. Thanks in advance. Hey Deazel73 :) Thanks ! I think this video can help you start with autotiles : youtube link I'm going to add more autotiles next week and fix some of the already existing ones. Give it a try and let me know ! absolutely love yuour work. Can you advise if the "unity" bundle contains all the assets for the set and if theyre in .PNG format at 16x16 pixels? I'm actuially looking to use the tiles as part of a large rpg style game I'm writing for an 8 bit computer called a zx spectrum next and the tiles fit the world I'd like to create perfectly. Hello :) yes everything is available in the unity package as well ! You will find 16x16 png too. Hello! Thanks for creating this, it'll help me a lot with my project. What are the legacy tiles? Was the pack reworked? I really liked the portal, arches and statues but I don't see them in the new version. Hey suumpmolk, Thank you ! Legacy tiles are indeed the very first version of the package (with portal and other sprites you've mentionned). They should be available within the full-version.zip âºï¸ This might be tedious work and I could do it myself but would you be able to also make strips of sprites? hello ! Yeah sure, what do you need exactly ? Downloaded this for use in a rpg maker vx ace, got surprised when i saw there was a vx ace folder just to get disappointed they're censored having giant "GET FULL VERSION" overlay texts, i understand you need to get money but i don't know that feels a bit scummy/false advertising doing stuff like that, probably just me that think that. Edit:Ok noticed that sounded a bit rude, basically i just have issues when someone say something is free then when you download it you notice not everything is actually free, it kinda make me feel like i got tricked/fooled especially since i was very excited to use this since i will be broke for awhile. Hey FlandreScarlet64, Well that's how I manage my projects on itchio (free + paid version). I can always rename the free zip package tho. I get it could be frustrating but that's also a way, as a potential buyer, to see how much content you'll get with the paid version. Moreover, I'll fix the overlay for rpgmaker this week since it censors too much content I believe ð¤. If you need a download key, no problemo, just send me a mail at pixelart.asset < at> gmail <dot> com, I'll be happy to help ð Will you fix overlay for other stuff too? i downloaded the other free packs, and the exterior pack you made, ALL images on the rpg maker vx ace folder have the overlay. Btw just a question if someone manage to remove the rpg maker overlays that you have put, would you count that as a pirating or would you count that as editing assets and allow usage? Yeah I'll fix for every pack that have this process ð. The free part at least should be available, maybe one autotile sheet too, I'll see. Btw, removing the scanline is considered pirating. Alright good to know for both of those. Hey mate, Dungeon/exterior/overworld pack have now a bunch of stuff for free in their respective rpgmaker/vxace/ packages. Right now just ~20/30% of the content is free I believe. Let me know how you feel about that and I'll adapt it I update my packs regularly so you can expect evolutions if you still feel that a bad move from me ð. As a reminder too : you can always send me a mail if you are short in cash. I'll send you download keys ð«¡ Totally agree, I got so excited because i was looking for good looking assets for almost a week now just to see the majority of it has a overlay, I wish somebody would just release good free assets. Yeah mate I get what you are looking for. Well, as I said, rpgmaker subfolder content will have some free assets (that was an error). Should be fixed today btw. If you need to give it a try with the full version I can send you a download key ð. Which engine are you using ? Well, I'm not using engines i'm coding all i need are the assets, I could cut it out, I'm not the greatest coder considering i haven't learned yet but i'm dreaming of making a rpg so if you have just the assets alone i'd be ok with that Edit: ngl i'm trying my luck with scratch.com I see :) well I'm sorry you hit a wall when downloading my free pack. I'm updating my assets regularly and making some of them free is a recent feature actually. Send me a mail at pixelart.asset <a> gmail.com so I can give you a bunch of pack keys ð Ok i gotta charge my ipad, because my computer is about to die edit: still can't find my charger ;-; My scratch account is 4899864361ej, once i send you the email ( Later today) check my scratch account i'm gonna try my best to make a rpg using some tutorials ofc Do you have any recomendations for an rpg maker for a new coder? I want to have a farming system and food that gives different allocations Every rpg maker version can do that kind of game ð¤. They have just differences in layer managements, resolution and some event options. They also have different scripts langage (vxace : Ruby, mv/mz : Javascript). You can event use rpg maker 2003 or xp if you are short in cash. is there anyway to DM on itch.io because i don't wanna share my email on this page Looking at the development log from 2020, there are tiles there that aren't in this pack. Are they exclusive for Unity? Hello Rorikingames :) Ah ! Some legacy tiles may have been replaced, yes. What tiles would you like to be added ? Ah that's too bad, I just really liked the brickwall tiles seen in those updates but the ones included already are great too so no worries. Great work btw the tiles are beautiful! Hi! I bought your collection like a while back. The only thing I'm missing is some monster sprites! Any chance you will do a monster pack(action rpg style) like with 4 directions, attack etc. ? That would make it complete! Or do you know of any that could match with your tile sets? Thank you!! I am a new developer using game maker studio 2 as my development engine for now. Thank you for this awesome pack to get me started. I will let you know when I get a working demo of some kind or another. Hello Ghiga5 :) Thanks, hope you will make a cool project <3 Fine asset to use. Thanks, Jonathan ! Hi, I really like all the art you have on your page and recently purchased one of your bundles, I plan on using the art for an indie game I am developing, I was curious about the crediting, I was planning on putting you and your partner's name in the credits of the game as is stated in the terms of use of the art, but I don't understand the link to Twitter/itch, do I put it in the credits? (altho it wont be clickable) or would you rather me put it in my devlogs whenever I am talking about the level design? I just want to make sure I get everything right! :) Hi Sin_Remover ! Thank you for your support :). Oh that's right, well if you mention our Twitter name (@gif_not_jif and @Noiracide) in your credits, that will do ð¥°ð. Great! Then ill do it like that! Ill put your guys Twitter handles in the credits :) I don't know if you know this, but any asset that you load into your demo can be easily ripped using a simple page inspection. I took a screenshot of me doing this, this is so easy that a child could rip these assets. I recommend taking down the demo if you want to protect your assets. (Did you use RPG Maker? That program is completely unsafe for protecting your assets online. I made a whole video about it once I think where I ripped all the MV assets from the main RPG Maker webpage before the engine had even been released.) Hello korytoombs ! Yeah, unfortunately, I'm aware of this issue. The solution was to scanline all the assets to prevent a decent usage of them by thieves. Moreover, not all of my assets are available in this demo (mostly because of this rip issue, indeed). Since this demo is quite small, I probably won't change the game engine or the solution behind to fix that :). Thanks for your analyse anyway ! Okay, as long as you are aware of it. I don't think a lot of people using that engine know this vulnerability. yeah, with Rpg maker it's pretty weird indeed. Even the cryptographic functionnality is a joke :( Hello there, using the tileset for a prototype and I really like it so far. Found some minor issues and having some suggestions after using them. Issues (atlas file): Suggestions: Keep up the good work, looking forward to your next packs. Hello wallchicken, I appreciate your feedback :). There are, indeed, mistakes and errors that I didn't took the time to fix yet. I'm adding your suggestions to this pack's todo list but I can't provide a delivery date yet. Good luck with your prototype ! We need Icons pack and Effect attack pack will be nice be couse on rpg maker or unity we need this :) Hello NewEnemy :) We are currently working on an action RPG pack which contain attack animation ! Some cool looking stuff here! I really appreciate how you have different size tilesets. That saves us a lot of time. <3 Hey Lowres! Love the packs, just wondering though why you decided to split them up into parts? Hello RyanAvx, Thanks ! If you are talking about the tiles/ folder in the Exterior pack : it's just another way to present the atlas for specific usage. If you are talking about the different Super Retro World projects : making separated packs gives people the choice to buy just the needed parts for a lower price (that's our spirit for now). Some packs are grouped into coop-bundle tho :). hi! i recently bought your super retro world bundle and this pack seems to be the only one that doesn't have a tile set tuned for rpg maker uses. was wondering if you planned on adding something like that or if i just happened to miss something, thanks :) Hello regeki :) I'll take a look at it this week ! In case you need it now : the atlas file provided is still "almost" ready for RpgMaker (just need to cut it into 256*256 pieces and triple its scale). Hello regeki, I've just made an update for that. Is it ok for you now ? I have a wonderful and very unique idea for a game that your tiles will be perfect for. Do you do any consulting work if I needed something tweaked for it. Hello fuqlibs, Thanks for your comment :). Unfortunately I don't have much time for that. I love it! Could I use it in a commercial game with minor modifications? BTW will you keep updating it? ^^ Hello Jobegiar99 :) You can use them the way the tiles are drawn in a commercial game. Not sure about the modifications yet. Any request for an update :) ? Have a nice day ! Yay! Thank you !!!! Yes!! I have one. I was trying to create a room with this kind of perspective but I was not able to find something to connect the borders, and I was wondering if possible if you could please create some assets for that kind of perspective (if there is already something like that I'm sorry xp) . (The image is just to illustrate what I'm trying to achieve). I would also like to know if it could be possible to please add something like traps, for example, a pit trap, fire trap, spike trap, etc. Thanks for taking part of your time to read my message! :) BTW I LOVE IT!!!! This is the best dungeon asset pack I have ever seen lol <3 Hello, this is a very nice set, and your others are too I bought them all! Bits and pieces of these go quite nicely with my ( https://numeron.itch.io | http://numeronreactor.com ) existing library of tiles which is a grand combination of original, derivative and third party stuff. To help merge your stuff in I'd also like to make modifications, in particular I'd like to: Not saying I have anything in particular in mind that I want to do (except perhaps re-colour the portal and arches), but allowing modifications really helps me not have to worry about merging stuff into my project when I go diving through my library for something new :) A license would solve this issue - I notice your exterior pack comes under MIT which is great, but everything else is unlicensed. Anyway, you have a great and consistent design language :) Hope you come out with more in the future, keep up the good work! Hello Numeron, Thanks for your big reply, I'll take a look at licence tonight for each of my pack :). Have a good day ! Hey there, so I was curious what CC license these assets are listed under? Hello smartguy1669, Good question, I haven't thought about it yet. Is it an issue for you ? You can use them in a commercial game if you want to. Wow a great top down tileset! I think I might pick up the bundle. Hello LVGames :) Thank you ! Don't hesitate to comment, I'll update this pack a few times before starting the 3rd one. Merci pour ce magnifique pack j'ai hÃ¢te de me procurer les prochains ð Salut Kaisen Isekai, Compte sur moi pour continuer ! Le prochain pack sera un ensemble de personnages et de monstres pour donner un peu de vie Ã tout Ã§a :). waiting for unity package. i love srw. This weekend for sure, thank you ! Lovely assets. It would be nice to include some reference/example pictures in the package. If possible, I'd like to have more animations of the treasure chest, door, portal and water etc. :) One unit wide terrain tiles (not sure what's the proper way to call it) would be nice too, for example the dirt path in the first picture of this asset page, the minimum width is 2 unit. I found the terrain tile tool in Unity's official 2d extra package very useful for painting the scene. But not many artist are doing this one unit wide terrain tiles. Hello WhiteGlint, You are right, I could give exemples. Animations should be updated this weekend, I'll update the terrain too ! Thx :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack includes a variety of 16x16 Nes pallet based assets for creating environments like City this package is part of a large set of environments that can be purchased by clicking on the link below Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. I can't cut the tiles. when I go to slice them it's just one big slice WARNING - Many assets in the NES Collection will not work on original hardware as there are sometimes more than 4 colours per 8x8 block, I've found some with 6 per 8x8. So if you are purchasing for authenticity or to actually to use on original NES hardware / emulators, be prepared to edit the artwork yourself like I am doing. I think the assets look good, it is why I purchased the collection, and this collection will be fine without modification on a modern engine going for an 8-bit / NES look. it doesnt have tile for clear blue sky.... you wait I will make a full game Love the legacy action pack. A post apocalyptic city would be great if you ever add to it. can these be used in a commercial title? what size tiles are these? It's awesome! It would be nice if the player had an idle gun pointing up/down instead of only when running It is not 'idle' while running, it is 'aim forward-down.' I already jiggied up some frames, I was just saying it would be nice to have the player aim up diagonally while standing still... Thanks so much! I am a big fan of this style, and you do it well! Thank for your set. Thank you for your set. Very cool pack! Realy thanks :D I just purchase your legacy bundle awesome work!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Action Combat Platformer Template$1</TITLE>
<TEXT>Demo Controls - MAKE SURE YOU CLICK INSIDE THE GAME SCREEN FOR INPUTS TO WORK This is a platformer project I've been working on in my spare time, it was a lot of fun and taught me many things. I've stopped working on this project for weeks now, and thought it would be cool to let others download it and hopefully learn some interesting ways to approach platformers. I've set the minimum price to 1 dollar because I feel there are code in this project that took me quite a bit of effort to come up with and to make functional, but I also wanted the files to be accessible to anyone who really wanted it. What This Includes This is a basic platformer with all the fundamental functions along with a couple very simple enemy types and a few obstacles in case you wanted to explore ways to design these systems. Disclaimer: I tried to comment as much as possible while creating this project, but there are many places where I don't. Though I feel like if you did read through where I had comments you would recognize and see familiarity in the rest, I can't promise that. I tried to keep my code as clean as possible, but I would still say you should be familiar with Game Maker Studio and GML before deciding to download this project file. If you have any questions or need help, I am definitely up to helping with any questions you may have. The best place to contact me would be twitter @LvlUpper or through the comments on here. Please give me a few days, especially on here because I don't check this website each day. In order to download this asset pack you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $1 USD. You will get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Wow, really good project! If someone ask, it works in The Game maker studio 2 v.2022.2.491 (the version of game maker riht now) Cool man! funciona en unity? For anyone curious. This does indeed work with GMS2. When you have downloaded the file, you'll have to use the import feature in the home menu of GMS2. works in GMS2? This is really solid, I've been looking for a good way to implement enemies, currency, and such into my platformer. So will definitely make use of it! Good Work! Is this for GMS 1.4 or for 2? [Edit: Purchased and it works wonderfully in 1.4! Thank you] works in GMS2? I just want to ask can i use sprite art in this game to my other game,in commercial use i will put credits and link to your profile. Cool project Is there a way to retrieve the art without having gamemaker installed? is this for commerical use? i want to add this Player Sprites to my game and sell it or free with ads Yes! Absolutely, it is up to you what you wish to do with this asset. Thanks for checking it out.</TEXT>

I really like this asset ( And I have it for quite some time now ) But I was just wondering if the laser beam would be animated some day :/ ? I know this asset is also kinda finished/abandonned in terms of production and update, but I would be so happy to just have that single addition to the asset And I will be honest too, It will drive soo many more buyers if you have this laser beam as a gif and final addition to this asset, because a lot of the traffic comes from the thumbnail, which in this case showcase the laser beam, but isn't present So that's just my 2 cents, take care ! Hey Empyrean, thank you for these helpful suggestions! I will implement most of these, if not all, in the future. Thank you! wow super nice asset! i will expect another asset too! Thank you, cheers! Hi, i bought this a while ago, and it's still kinda unusable for me in this state, everything is all around the place, the character animations spritesheet are so condensed without separations or indications, i don't know what is what, would it be possible to repackage the whole thing please? Still in the same apocalyptic state. Great quality, but the amout of pain to sort things out and be finally be able to use them is just absurd. Please reconsider your delivery, because I've yet to see worse here on Itch. My apologies, Ill do my best to fix them. What formats would you like to see? (Examples would help) Hey jason. There's 2 formats that are really convenient to use: - Single frames in separate folders for each animations (ex: one folder with run animation with 4 frames in it, one folder with attack, and so on) - Small spritesheets of each animations (one sheet for walk, one sheet for attack and so on) If you can do both it's even better Thanks 8bit, great suggestions. Ill upload them all tonight! Hey there. I purchased the pack but the archive only contains projectiles, impacts and smoke spritesheets. Let me know if its fixed! Hello! Yep thanks, I got the character movesets & the hero sprites ;) mobs & tileset however are nowhere to be seen, are they a work in progress ? Hey, is the beam effect from the thumbnail included now? Regards Unfortunately, its not animated : ( Hey. I just purchased and downloaded the pack â love the work! I was especially interested in the character and smoke animations. But only the projectiles and impacts are as png within the rar folder. As I work exclusively with Photoshop, character and smoke sprites as png would be highly desired. Only other chance for me would be to buy aseprite just to export as png. Thank you. I must have missed those animations, my apologies. Will upload them later today! Thanks a lot for your reply and for adding the smoke effects. But the character is still missing as pngs (also enemies, tiles, movesets). Thanks for responding! attack, walk, idle, hit and death animations of the 4 you have shown, or snake even. I assume commercial use is allowed since not listed??? I love the slime you made btw Edit: just saw that commercial use is allowed. Sorry, thanks Nice! Do you plan to animate the enemies? Yup! Are there any placeholder enemies/animations you'd like to see? Cool, but where can I find this beam like effect? Its not included at the moment but it will be added in the future :) Is it included now? Incredible ! This looks amazing! I will buy both Base-Set and Complete-Set when the money is less tight. I don't really comment due to my laziness but for this i really want to congratulate for your great work! I waited patiently till today. To be honest, the offer is not really clear but it will with time. Canât wait the base tileset and big images to make in situation. Could you send me the gamemaker studio 2 files please ? Thank you very much love your passion and the thing you want to do with learnindie. Canât wait for more ! Thank you for the kind words and for the patience! A portion of this asset is still in its creation process. Once a majority is complete, Ill have an epic trailer ready As for the Gamemaker Studio 2 files, Ill focus on those once all the art assets are complete. ok not a problem for me ! Thanks for your answer I saw this on reddit a while ago, but never expected to see this here. Beautiful ! Congratulations ! Thank you! :D</TEXT>

Hi, I purchased this on gamedev market the other day before seeing it on here (half the price that I paid) but the package on gamedev market doesn't include the interior sprites like this package mentions, it must be outdated. Can you send me the package with the interior sprites? thanks. Great little pack for simple projects! I do wish the sheets were more structured with only the art assets uniformly distributed. It would make the tile-sheets much easier to import in most game engines. If you can split them up on a grid thatâs the way to go. Hey Turner, happy that you like it! Will definitely do that so that it's easier to import. Thanks a lot for the feedback! No problem, thanks for the cool asset, it made it a lot easier to do a simple project for school without having to take the time to make the sprites myself. neeed this 4 the playdatee Nicee ! I need to try it too to see how it'll look Looks a lot like Minit. Yep, i took inspiration from it and from gato roboto so cute! good work, seems beautiful. Thanks :)</TEXT>

The people were not willing to change their lifestyles and the planet was dying. Their scientists found a solution and decided to pump the waste and dangerous substances from the atmosphere deep into the rock bed of the planet. Years passed and all was fine until earthquakes started to rattle the world more and more. The waste in the ground had reacted with the rock bed causing it to dissolve and the planets crust crumbled into the sea. Only a few plateaus remains of the once beautiful planet.

<TITLE>Action Sequence Impact plugin for RPG Maker MV$8.99-10%</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool This plugin adds new Action Sequences to Yanfly's Battle Engine Core (so make sure you have that plugin and the Action Sequence Packs installed) to add a couple of new effects such as balloons, move adjustments, easings, projectiles, and if you have Olivia's Battle Impact plugin, the special impact effects, too! This plugin is made compatible with Olivia's Battle Impact plugin: Radian Adjustments These are used for projectile Action Sequences. If a projectile is angled, then the "arrow head" will be the upper left corner of the icon and the lower left corner of an animation. These are the default values. If your icons or animations are made differently, you can adjust the radians to your liking. If you want to know how to convert degrees to radians, use this math formula below: radians = degree * (Pi / 180) This is left as a constant for all projectiles to keep the math done properly during its calculation mid-Action Sequence. As mentioned before in the introduction, this plugin adds new Action Sequences to Yanfly's Battle Engine Core. If you don't have those plugins, you can download them for free from here: Some of the action sequences added in this pack also require Olivia's Battle Impact plugin to use, but those are optional. If you can get Olivia's plugin here: After that, you could use the Acton Sequences in the sections below. Before I begin on the Action Sequences, I want to say there's two new additions to the targeting mechanism. You know the parts where you put in "user" or "targets"? Now, during the <Target Actions> phase, you can use either "Prev Target" or "Next Target" to grab either the previous one or the next target in the list. This part of the document will now be formatted like Yanfly's Action Seq help file to bring about a sense of familiarity. This plugin is made for and tested on RPG Maker MV with version 1.6.2. I cannot guarantee if it works on lower versions. 1. These plugins may be used in free or commercial games. 2. 'RPG Maker Irina' must be given credit in your games. 3. You are allowed to edit the code. 4. Do NOT change the filename, parameters, and information of the plugin. 5. You are NOT allowed to redistribute these Plugins. 6. You may NOT take code for your own released Plugins. In order to download this tool you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $8.99 USD. You will get access to the following files:</TEXT>

This plugin gives players the ability to fast forward or skip entire Battle Action Sequeneces altogether and show that you, as a game developer, respects the player's time and decision on how they wish to play your game. You could change the buttons to perform these actions, but from the plugin's default settings, you could fast forward by holding down the designated OK button (Z or Space on keyboard or holding the left mouse button down). To toggle Auto-Fast Forward, pressing Page Up or Q can do that or by pressing the Fast Forward button on the screen. If you haven't changed the button setup, skipping animations can be done by holding down the designated Cancel Button (X or Escape on keyboard by the right mouse button). To toggle Auto-Skip Forward, pressing Page Down or W will toggle the Auto-Skip Forward feature or by pressing the Skip Forward button on the screen. This plugin requires Yanfly's Battle Engine Core to work. It is also recommended that you download all of Yanfly's other Action Sequence Packs, in addition to the Battle Engine Core, too. You can find them here: There are two UI buttons that I've made for you all to use freely with your projects if you don't know how to make them or just want to use it to temporarily take place until you make your own graphics. You can download them from this page. If you wish to make your own UI graphics, just make them like a regular 1x2 spritesheet, where the off graphic is on the left and the on graphic is on the right. There are no frame dimension limitations, but you must use the same dimensions for both frames. The settings below this all pertain to the Fast Forward feature added by this plugin. You can adjust the Fast Forward speed, the buttons used for it, the window information displayed, and the UI button for toggling Fast Forward on or off. Settings: These adjust the main components of the Fast Forward effect. The Hold Button is the button that's pressed and held down for Fast Forward to occur and stops when the button is released. The Toggle Button will actually switch between on and off for Auto-Fast Forward, where the player does not need to hold down the Fast Forward button. The Speed adjusts the speed at which the fast forwarding occurs. Options: These options determine how the Auto-Fast Forward feature appear in the in-game Options menu. If you want to learn how to add the option to Yanfly's Options Core, look in the section below this one. Window: When Fast Forward is on, a message will appear on the screen to alert the player of what's going on. This section lets you change the window's message, font settings, coordinates, and more. Button: If you wish, you can have a UI button appear on screen for players to click with their mouse to turn on/off Auto-Fast Forward. In this section, you can select the graphic used and the coordinates it's placed at. The settings below this all pertain to the Skip Forward feature added by this plugin. You can adjust the Skip Forward power, the buttons used for it, the window information displayed, and the UI button for toggling Skip Forward on or off. Settings: These adjust the main components of the Skip Forward effect. The Hold Button is the button that's pressed and held down for Skip Forward to occur and stops when the button is released. The Toggle Button will actually switch between on and off for Auto-Skip Forward, where the player does not need to hold down the Skip Forward button. The Speed adjusts the speed at which the skip forwarding occurs since skipping is actually a higher powered fast forward. Damage Tally Timing lets you determine what damage counts will appear at the end of the skip. Fade Duration is how many frames the game will take fading in and out between skipping. Options: These options determine how the Auto-Skip Forward feature appear in the in-game Options menu. If you want to learn how to add the option to Yanfly's Options Core, look in the section below this one. Window: When Skip Forward is on, a message will appear on the screen to alert the player of what's going on. This section lets you change the window's message, font settings, coordinates, and more. Button: If you wish, you can have a UI button appear on screen for players to click with their mouse to turn on/off Auto-Skip Forward. In this section, you can select the graphic used and the coordinates it's placed at. There are some notetags that you can use with this plugin. Place these inside your items or skills that you want them to affect. Note: Making the speed too high will have possible unforeseen consequences that the plugin cannot foresee nor fix. This is because the fast forward and skip functions function off a macroscale that speeds up the game's update frequency. This does not take into consideration the game's delta time since that's impossible to do without causing other problems. It is your own due diligence as a game developer to find the right speeds for each item/skill that won't break the system. If your item/skill's battle action sequence runs a common event that requires you to temporarily stop Fast Forward and Skip Forward, you can use these plugin commands to control them: If you want to integrate Auto-Fast Forward and Auto-Skip Forward into Yanfly's Options Core plugin, use the settings below: This plugin is made for and tested on RPG Maker MV with version 1.6.2. I cannot guarantee if it works on lower versions. 1. These plugins may be used in free or commercial games. 2. 'RPG Maker Irina' must be given credit in your games. 3. You are allowed to edit the code. 4. Do NOT change the filename, parameters, and information of the plugin. 5. You are NOT allowed to redistribute these Plugins. 6. You may NOT take code for your own released Plugins. In order to download this tool you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $8.99 USD. You will get access to the following files:</TEXT>

<TITLE>Action Cutin plugin for RPG Maker MV$10.79-10%</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable tool This RPG Maker MV plugin lets you add action cutins display actor and enemy faces in a cutout box with speedlines going through the back. It can be used inside and outside of battle provided that you use the right notetags and/or script calls with them. It can be used to put emphasis on which actor or enemy is currently performing an action or it can be solely used for very strong attacks. The choice is yours. You will be able to customize how action cutins look for each facet of a skill or item or even make templates when used with multiple battlers at a time. You can also choose what graphic to use for each actor/enemy when a cutin appears, as well as the scaling, the offsets, and anti-aliasing. Those who lack the time and/or ability to make their own graphics for cutins, don't worry. This plugin will automatically convert face graphics and enemy graphics* into a usable form for cutin effects as it will work right out of the box as long as you download the Speedlines graphic that comes with this plugin. *Note: The automatic conversion will not be applied to animated Dragonbones battlers because that's a whole different animal to tackle and you're better off using still graphics for that. This plugin works best with the following plugins: Battle Engine Core: This plugin gives access to new action sequences that become available if Battle Engine Core is installed in the same project. The action sequences allow you to set up cutins anywhere and anytime you want them during an action sequence with a full range of customization settings. Animation Screen Effects: - or - Screen Shake Effects: Both of these plugins give access to a better looking screen shake, which makes cutins appear even more intense as they zoom across the screen. For those who want portraits to use with this plugin, you can grab them from Caz! 1. Download the 'Speedlines' graphic from this plugin's page. 2. Place it inside your project's img/pictures/ folder. 3. If you're using YEP_BattleEngineCore, place this plugin beneath it. 4. If you're using MogHunter's Battle HUD, place this plugin above it. 5. Configure the settings in the Plugin Parameters to your liking. 6. Configure your actors, enemies, skills, and items with notetags. 7. Use action sequences and script calls to call action cutins outside of the normal scope of item and skill usage. Here's an explanation of the what the Plugin Parameters do: General Settings: Above Window Layer: Cutins have their own graphics layer. They can be placed either beneath the Window Layer or above it. If it is beneat the Window Layer, then the UI elements added to the game's Window Layer will be visible. If it is above it, then the UI elements will appear behind the cutins, though parts of the UI can be seen if the cutins use certain blend modes. All ___ Have Cutins: These settings allow you to automatically set certain subsets of skills and/or items to have cutins appear whenever used. Keep in mind that just because one is set to false doesn't mean they're forever kept away from having cutins. As long as another condition is met, cutins will appear. You can also force cutins to appear with the <Action Cutin> notetag placed inside of a skill or item's notebox. Likewise, you can prevent them from appearing if the <No Action Cutin> notetag is present as well. The settings from these auto cutins will occur whenever a "perform start" action sequence occurs, or if you're using the default battle system, the "performActionStart" entry occurs in Window_BattleLog. Templates: JavaScript users can create their own action cutin templates here to make certain styles of cutins occur. Included with this plugin are two example pieces for a group "horizontal" and "vertical" action cutin combo where multiple appear at once. Look further down in the help file to learn how to use templates. Default Speedlines: These settings determine the default settings for the speedlines graphic that appears with the action cutins. These settings aren't final for all action cutins, but instead, serve as the base/default settings and can always be changed with notetags, action sequences, and templates. Default Face Settings: The face that appears during a cutin sequence will move from one direction to the other. You can adjust the settings here to change how it moves by default. These settings aren't final for all action cutins, but instead, serve as the base/default settings and can always be changed with notetags, action sequences, and templates. Auto-Flash: Turning this on will accompany a screen flash when the action cutin appears. Here, you can adjust the default color and duration of the flash. These settings aren't final for all action cutins, but instead, serve as the base/default settings and can always be changed with notetags, action sequences, and templates. Auto-Shake : Turning this on will accompany a screen shake when the action cutin appears. Here, you can adjust the power, speed, and duration of the shake. These settings aren't final for all action cutins, but instead, serve as the base/default settings and can always be changed with notetags, action sequences, and templates. Auto-Sound : Turning this on will accompany a sound effect when the action cutin appears. Here, you can pick the file, volume, pitch, and pan of the sound. These settings aren't final for all action cutins, but instead, serve as the base/default settings and can always be changed with notetags, action sequences, and templates. Other: These are the other settings that you can adjust for action cutins, including the total duration of the action cutin and the opacity speed at which it fades in and out. These settings aren't final for all action cutins, but instead, serve as the base/default settings and can always be changed with notetags, action sequences, and templates. Insert the following notetags in the appropriate database entries. The notetags placed into Actor and Enemy noteboxes are used to define their own personal cutins. The notetags placed inside Skill and Item noteboxes are used to define the cutin settings associated when using that skill/item. If you are using these notetags for actors and classes, priority will be given to the actor notetags before given to the class notetags. Action cutins can be called upon and used in either in battle or on the map screen. To call them, there's various ways of doing so. Look below for instructions on how to get each one working. These require knowledge of how to use JavaScript to utilize. I am not responsible for improper usage or teaching you how to use JavaScript so you can further use these. If you wish to understand how to use RPG Maker MV's JavaScript base, I suggest taking a look at Trihan's "Jump Into JavaScript" article found here: https://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/1230/ If you don't like the settings made in certain skills/items or would just like to create your own without having to create new skills/items, then start with the following code. This grabs the default cutin settings. As long as you modify it before inserting it into $actionCutin or $actionCutinTemplate, then the settings will behave differently from the default. Below is a list of the various things you can do to your code to change it up. You're not required to use all of them. Just pick the settings alterations that need changing. Pick and choose the setting changes you want before inserting them into $actionCutin or $actionCutinTemplate's arguments. Below is an example of how to use it in a complete script call. The above script call changes the speedlines to have a hue of 180 while changing the blend mode to 'Normal'. A regular single battler action cutin is then used through the $actionCutin function. This section only applies to you if you use Yanfly's Battle Engine Core and its action sequences. If you don't use either, you're free to ignore this section. This part of the document will be formatted like Yanfly's Action Sequence help file to bring about a sense of familiarity. This plugin is made for and tested on RPG Maker MV with version 1.6.2. I cannot guarantee if it works on lower versions. 1. These plugins may be used in free or commercial games. 2. 'RPG Maker Irina' must be given credit in your games. 3. You are allowed to edit the code. 4. Do NOT change the filename, parameters, and information of the plugin. 5. You are NOT allowed to redistribute these Plugins. 6. You may NOT take code for your own released Plugins. In order to download this tool you must purchase it at or above the minimum price of $10.79 USD.

<TITLE>Action Priest</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows What Is Action Priest? Action Priest is a First-person action adventure game based around a Priest who starts a long bloodline of priests which all portray the mannerisms of classic 80s action heroes, where demons rule the land and your bloodline must âfinish what Jesus startedâ (the main motto) which means to cleanse the land of demons. Originally Action Priest started as a final project at University for 2 of our members. After graduation we grouped together with 4 other postgraduate students to create Buccanerds. Since then we have been developing our ideas to have a solid foundation before we start full development which will start during July 2019. Our team consists of the following; Game Designer, Programmer, Level Designer/Producer, Enviromental Artist/Visual Designer, Technical Sound Designer, Prop/Concept Artist. Current Build Currently we have a very early prototype that has 1 playable level along with 2 weapons, 3 enemy types and a boss. Additionally we have some test scenes created aimed towards setting the mood and the art-style that we will be going for once we fully go into development as we are on hold until the end of June. Current Build Visuals Test Scene Visuals The Plan The plot and plan for Action priest, is to involve different time periods with different bloodlines of Action priest. This will give more environment and story opportunities whilst also giving more chapter potentials. The idea is a long scale story of a never-ending battle against demons, where the whole bloodline of action priest is involved trying to stop the source of the demons. We aim to achieve a story-line where we can take the player on a adventure through different time periods with a variety of different protagonists whilst really emphasising the development of these time periods and what defined them.

<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack Music for RPGs or action adventure games, includes music for town settings, intense orchestral battle music and more. Also, several musical sound effects are included, such as triumph fanfares and game over sounds. Feel free to use the files in your project, commercial or not. Get original music from me: https://www.fiverr.com/share/AyW6lX Update 1.6 includes a new track: BGM00hero, a heroic orchestral theme. Update 1.5 includes many newer tracks (formerly included in other of my packages) of higher quality. Outdated tracks have Â«OLDÂ» in the file name. Musical tracks have loop points so it will be easier for you to make the music loop forever in your game. Files with names ending with "NL" don't have loop points because they are musical sound effects meant to be played once. Samples: Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hi! Thank you for the free high quality content! I have one small request, if it's not too much to ask would you mind making an archive of all the music to download? Just to save time over downloading 1 by 1. :) Good morning, what kind of license do you grant for the material? Is it cc0 or cc4? Could you explain it? I would like to make use of your material for commercial purposes. You can use these files in any kind of commercial product (game, video, etc.). This means you can include my music in your game and sell the game and there's no need to ask for my permission or anything. You can edit the files if you want, I just ask anyone who edits the files to NOT credit me. You cannot directly sell these files I make available for free. This means you can't create a "music pack" with my music in it and sell it like "RPG music pack 1", or sell the individual files anywhere. thanks for your answer then its content is cc4, as soon as I finish my game, I will attach a link so that you can see it if you want and of course that I will place it in the visible credits. Hey! I really liked your content and used it in my game for a university subject, I put you in my credits.

<TITLE>Action Sheep Counter 3000</TITLE>
<TEXT>One man (or woman), one task... and infinite sheep. There is only one thing to do: count them all! Controls: click on the button to count when a sheep passes by. The quicker the sheep are coming, the quicker you can count. Disclaimer: I am not responsible for you dying from thirst because you don't dare stop counting. Made for the Game Makers Toolkit Jam 2019, using Unity, Visual Studio, Aseprite, Bosca Ceoil and Audacity. Sounds taken from freesound.org: https://freesound.org/people/kiddpark/sounds/201159/ https://freesound.org/people/soundmary/sounds/196671/ https://freesound.org/people/kyles/sounds/453763/ https://freesound.org/people/Iwiploppenisse/sounds/156031/ Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. looks great, is pretty fun. sometimes the buttons wouldn't let me click them despite having the cash. Was about to be mad that the sheep counter button was not keeping up with the sheep speed, but then they learned mathematics and all was forgiven :D nice little game!! Love it! Buying the Quantum Mechanics is a fun twist on the clicker game genre. Thank you :) It somehow almost automatically came to this kind of end. One should never underestimate sheep. Wow. This made me laugh Yay! I am happy to hear that! Thanks for playing :) Honestly I find myself loving this. It's super simple, instantly reminds of me of things like cookie clicker or the like. Really cool be fun if expanded into a game kind of like hedgehog launch which sticks with me now from my elementary school years into my adult life now. One of my fav entries so far. Yes, I was inspired by those clicker/idle games. I usually always polish my jam games and add some more content after the jams ends. So it is likely I will add some more features. Thank you for your nice words and for playing :) Really simple, but entertaining concept. The application of the theme was simple, but effective for the game Thank you for this positive feedback. Nice to hear :) And I am always happy to see my games being played. Thanks for that. I'm glad that I'd teach the sheep math! Now.. where is my water bottle :p Good news! You can now teach them also Quantum Mechanics ;) Thanks for playing!</TEXT>

<TITLE>Action RPG music pack: Infinity Crisis COMPLETE$25</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable music pack If last year's big project Infinity Crystal was the classic bold colourful JRPG, Crisis is its modern sequel/prequel/spinoff, featuring an emotional storyline and intense action! And even bigger. I also decided I wanted a fusion sound heavy guitars and electric cello , and taiko drums and traditional instruments . (Come on, who doesn't want that?!) It also means a really clear and striking musical identity for your project. I've aimed for an action/RPG feel, but tracks could fit in a variety of genres, have a listen. Over an hour of music, including battle themes, intense and relaxing background location pieces, storytelling builds and recurring themes, a huge big tragic-heroic large scale piece, and a vocal credits song. https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=305618385/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=4ec5ec/artwork=none/transparent=true/ Available in either ogg or wav format, the tracks in the pack are loopable rather than the soundtrack version fade-outs you hear in the bandcamp version above. You can look at the attached info pdf for descriptions of the tracks before purchasing. These pieces can be used in commercial and non-commercial games and their promotional materials, with credit given to me, Sara Garrard. See the full Terms of Use. There is also a sample version of ten of these tracks available for free: Infinity Crisis CORE . Thank you very much for checking out this pack! it's been totally my baby this spring. Purchasing my music packs is obviously a wonderful way to support the creation of more -- and so is rating and commenting, I would love to hear what you think.

First of all, I have to thank Aaron for providing me with the key. You are one of the most generous human beings and I will respect you for that till my last breath on earth. Thank you â¤ The games blew my mind. In terms of consistency, none of them had any issues. The stories were exciting and nerve wrecking, especially Aaron's game, as the lady with the "tea" gave me cold sweat, I could not look at her or even towards her direction. Bravo all of you! The third game surprised me a lot and had a very minimalistic look. It reminded me of old console games, with a little mini map. Such a vibe. With the second game, the color pallets were beautiful. In the end, I was very satisfied with the result. Best of luck with the future developments and collaborations. Cheers to you mates ð· Edit: FYI, I never drink tea, but you can poison me with beer lol. thank you so much Niven for the amazing feedback & support. I really do appreciate it & iâm sure the Darnell & Adriano do also.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Narrative Clone: Box Pushing Edition</TITLE>
<TEXT>WASD - move Space - interact R - reset level (you keep all of your items when you reset) This is an elaboration of my clone of a narrative clone. I have given the game Sci-Fi retheme, where the player is a scientist trying to find the professor so they can shut down the lab and get some lunch. I have added a pushing and repetition mechanic. The gameplay is primarily based around a series of box pushing puzzles. Given that these puzzles can be rendered unsolvable I had to add a restart mechanic, that allows the player to keep all the items they have collected. This is actually what inspired me to use the Sci-Fi lab theme. I wanted to integrate the repetition as some kind of small-scale time travel instead of just having it as a game mechanic.

<TEXT>PLAY TEST FEEDBACK 1. Were the dialogue mechanics intuitive? Yes 2. Did the dialogue make you feel more immersed in the game? To some extent. Single dialogue options felt slightly tedious, multiple choices were cool. 3. Did you find the characters to be more relatable or interesting? Yes, most definitely. Multiple dialogue choices. Enjoyed friendships and opinions. 4. If you could say more to the NPCs, what would you say? More of a way to learn about the player character. Reflect more about the player when talking to NPCs. 5. Could you feel a stronger connection to your character? It was stronger. 6. Did you feel the dialogue options matched what you wanted to/would've said? More or less. It didn't get in the way. It was not a problem. 7. What was the most memorable, or your favorite, aspect of the game? When I called the NPC dumb or when he broke the forth wall. 8. What was your least favorite aspect of the game? Going to find the key could be integrated in the story.

<TITLE>Narrative XP</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Traditional XP systems, where you gain XP based on how many monsters you kill, can be slow and clunky. Levelling when you hit a milestone is much simpler but can sometimes feel arbitrary, or like your characters aren't working towards anything. This is my attempt at a middle ground, hopefully providing the best of both while fitting seamlessly into any system. Players take it in turns to give out give each other small, achievable goals, with all players levelling up when a predetermined number have been met. Plus the whole thing fits on a business card which you pass around the table as you play. Inspired by games like Blades in the Dark (John Harper), Unbound (Grant Howitt and Chris Taylor) and E xpanded Experience Points (Mark Hulmes).

<TITLE>Narrative Game (2): Elaboration</TITLE>
<TEXT>Description : Previously, you were a mushroom being traversing through an unknown land in search of the mystical exit - in this reality, you're a squishy polar bear who has to convene with other cold-weathered critters in order to find your way back home, away from the sunny domains of spring! Will you spend your time picking up flowers for your mother back home or will you find the way out? Press Space to find out! P.S.: I added (actual) trees so that's why the screenshots don't include them! Instructions : To control your movements, use WASD: W for going up, A for going left, S for going down and D for going right. You can even move diagonally if you press A and W/S or D and W/S (diagonal left and diagonal right respectively) at the same time. To interact with other characters, hold Space! The text will disappear if you don't, so you can hold space for as long as you need to read. New action: To pick flowers, stand close to them and press "P" on your keyboard. And just like in the previous game, you don't need to press any buttons to pick up the key, you just need to walk over it! Merit : This project took a lot of my time, certainly when dealing with the textboxes, as I've mentioned from the first iteration of this project (I wasn't lying when I said they took years off of my life, maybe ). At the end of the day, though I'm not really sure if I managed to actually fix anything, I think overall I did a relatively nice job at first replicating the mechanics of the first project (the clone) and then implementing them into something that feels slightly more personal, more me (i.e.: adding my own art, sprites and sounds) which required a degree of work, and which ultimately strengthened my connection with this work. I am sure I could have done a bit better when it comes to the text box objects and fixing them and making them even more similar to the original narrative game's textboxes (i.e.: they disappear when you leave) but I think overall this small game has some merit, or some personal merit, rather; maybe perhaps in the near future I will be able to make a better narrative game based off of this one and perhaps I will have more things to be proud of, but for now I do enjoy the vague cuteness that I managed to bring to this "originally a mere clone" narrative game.

<TITLE>Narrative Game Template</TITLE>

You can find the full code on Github at github.com/reaganhenke/narrative-game , and clone it to create your own! Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hello IfThenCreate! Iâm using your Narrative Game Template as a starting point for a commercial game (with all new art, dialogue, and assets) but it's going to be a while before I release it. Your README says we can clone and publish on itch — is commercial use okay (even if it may be on other platforms like Steam)? If so, may I credit you as âTemplate by IfThenCreateâ? Aw It doesn't work anymore :( Are you on mobile? Looking into why that's not working... should still work on desktop though! ð Thank you for making this!

<TITLE>Narrative Design</TITLE>
<TEXT>This is a small starting village in an RPG setting. The game features interactable npcs, as well as various other objects, some of which even have extra hidden interactions. The game also begins to give the player money, introducing economy, as well as a few ways to spend and earn the money. There is also the basis for a karma system, and although the current implementation of this is small, it is very expandable. The vast majority of this projected was made using visual scripting, and this was my first time using this as part of a narrative design focused university module. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. The concept of this game is quite nice, however, this game needs to be polished a bit, currently, it's in a preliminary stage with a lot of bugs. In addition to that, you also have to improve the mechanics of the game and the movement too.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Narrative Dice Icons</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable asset pack This iconography was created as part of a project in the Coruscant Nights Podcast Discord server. We were bemoaning the fact that the official dice for the Star Wars Edge of the Empire RPG system had become too expensive when they went out of print and the rights shifted from Fantasy Flight to Edge Studios, but the symbols for them also still had Disney copyrights involved. Since one of the members could make custom dice a few of us tried our hands at making our own symbols that could be used for the same dice setup and meanings, but used without trying to fight with the lawyers at either Disney or Asmodee. These were mine, and were used to make some beautiful dice. You can buy your own set - if dice making isn't your thing - from the the first person to use these symbols on dice by shooting them an email here . Since the official dice remain hard to obtain (and expensive), and interest in free use symbols for the narrative dice has continued in the online community, I have decided to make my symbols available for any who wish to use them; for whatever projects you have. Whats included: .stl files for dice modeling .png files sized for discord Emoji (if you want to customize a dice bot) a symbol translation guide, if you are using them for Narrative dice *If there is enough interest and this actually earns anything, may look into doing a font set for the symbols too, for use in homebrew documents Narrative Dice Icons by Richard Allen is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License .

<TITLE>Narrative Tension</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game Game loop: 1. As a group, a narrative goal is picked involving one of the face card suits. The different face cards can follow narrative lines. King : Conflict | Queen : Love | Jack : Success e.g. the King defends a castle on the moon (The goal should be reasonable but also difficult) 2. Grab a deck of cards and take out any (number of players, up to 8 players) black cards and (1 through 3) red cards depending on how difficult you want it to be. Everybody takes one card and keeps the information of what color it is to themselves. After everybody remembers their color, put all the cards back into the deck and shuffle. Black cards are honest Red cards are liars 3. Repeat the Core loop 4. Once all the cards have been depleted where a full hand of 3 can not be made, reshuffle the Aceâs into the discard pile and continue. Core loop: 1. The first player draws three cards one at a time and creates a story that involves the cards, including any additional information. E.g. A drag queen was strolling down the street a quarter past 5 : 10. I walk into the King restaurant and see 3 meatballs of which I smother my 5 fingers into. 1a. If the card picked is an Ace a 3 minute round of deliberation begins to vote out one player from play or to skip the vote entirely, with the most voted option winning. After voting, the Ace is put on the bottom of the deck. 1b. If the player is a liar they can change any reference(s) to the three cards. 2. A quick yay or nay on keeping the narrative cannon is held, then a new rhetoric is created. 3. The three cards are then handed to the next person in the circle. They may look at them and then answer as many Yes or No questions as they like in 1 minute. Once the time is over, those cards are left in a discard pile and the loop starts once again. e.g. Were most of the cards red? Was the player lying about a card? Deliberation: - During deliberation all the players talk about kicking another player out of the group. - If there is a unanimous decision that there are no more liars in the group they may end the game to reveal everybodies identity. If there are still liars in the group the liars win. - If there is a tie, another round of voting begins after a minute of deliberation. After another tie, the game continues. Story: - The story must continue with each person adding to the story trying to get closer to the goal for the civilians to win. - The story must follow logical rules. Non-sequiturs can be rolled for, you may use the deck as a 13 sided die with it heavily balanced towards 10âs (face cards would be 10âs) or a D6. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A downloadable Hidden Objects Games for Windows, macOS, and Linux Hidden Object World Some instructions: Click download now to get access to the following files: View all posts Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Hello, your game looks nice. Can you add a note to the download of the Linux version that it's 64-bit only? If possible it would be nice if you could release a 32-bit executable. Nicely compiled levels, but the hidden objects are too obvious as they're much blurrier than the actual image. Also, an exit button would be nice on the main screen. Additionally, it would help if you edited the Start button into "Start new game" to make it clear that clicking on it starts an actual new game and all progress will be lost, now there is a popup window telling this but naming the button differently would also be helpful. Of course we will try to improve the quality little by little. Feedback like yours is always helpful. Thank you very much for that and we are glad that you had some fun with the game :)</TEXT>

Apologies for the buggy and wonky control scheme, I tried something highly experimental, and the game's engine simply doesn't like it. If I ever make such a game again I'll have had the time to do more QA on the controls, but this was built in under 72 hours for a game jam, meaning there was no QA.

<TITLE>[CGMZ] Hidden Objects for RPG Maker MZ$5</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable plugin Hi all, introducing [CGMZ] Hidden Objects ! This plugin adds a "hidden object" minigame, otherwise known as point and click game to RPG Maker. You create a background and foreground image, and then a bunch of objects hidden throughout the scene which will appear in front of the background but behind the foreground allowing you to partially obscure the objects. On the bottom, a window tracks which objects the player has found. To register an item as found, the player simply needs to click on the object. The collection window can take up a valuable portion of the screen in a hidden object scene, so this plugin includes functionality that can show or hide the collection window with a click to minimize any UI interference with the minigame. See below gif for how it can look: Objects in the scene can have different images displayed in the scene vs the object window, and they can also have unfound names that display before the object is found by the player. Names support text codes. See below image for how this may look: In the above image, the large Salamander object has a different image in the object window along with name ??? before it is found. This plugin also supports setting a Timer to limit how long the player has to look for objects in the scene. You can also use plugin commands to determine if a specific hidden object scene has been completed (all objects found). You can queue a common event to run after the scene ends as well. This plugin supports keyboard and gamepad users by allowing them to move a cursor sprite around the hidden object with standard directional inputs for maneuvering the cursor sprite. They can press the OK input to simulate a click wherever the cursor is, which is how they can collect the hidden objects. See below gif for comparison of touch ui and keyboard / gamepad cursor: Want additional features not already present/listed above?

PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING : Please be aware that you can access this as well as all of my other Alpha plugins for $5 on my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CasperGamingRPGM This is posted to Itch.io since some people only use Itch and are not aware my Patreon and all of my beta/alpha plugins exist, or want to have everything in one convenient location (itch.io), or do not want to do a monthly subscription. Casper Gaming's Beta/Alpha plugins are treated as an "early access" and will eventually be free for everyone once they are fully released, though this process can take months/years.

Is there anyway to "Check for Scene Completed" (after finding all the objects) while still in the hidden object scene? I wanted to run some events immediately after the player finds everything. Like a popup text or chime without have to back out. Hi, I don't think this would be that easy as events are not enabled in that scene. Is all you want to do is play a SE and show a popup text window? I can add toast integration to the scene and allow you to play a SE when the objects are all found in a future update. Thanks for the quick reply! Yeah, just a simple SE or melody when the player successfully finds everything would be great! Hi, just wanted to let you know that today the plugin was updated to allow playing a SE on scene completion as well as showing a [CGMZ] Toast Window popup when the scene is completed. Sweet! Thank you for adding that in! Of all your works, this alone is the one where i'm like "yeah please let us download a free demo", knowing how this feels to play would be huge in considering buying it :) that said, your prices are always insane so $5 to test it is fine anyways, just a suggestion <3 Keep up the insane work, fr. Thank you and God bless Hi, thank you for the kind words ð making free demos for paid plugins is tricky because it would also need to include the plugin. I know some people use a free/paid model with incredibly limited features in their free version, but it is a lot of extra work to maintain 2 versions of each plugin especially as [CGMZ] is over 90 plugins big now so it is not something I think I could do at the moment. Thank you for the suggestion though, I will keep it in mind. Will you make an MV version? I am assuming that this is only for MZ. Hi, this is for MZ only. I have no plans to port my MZ plugins over to MV at this time. Ah I see. Well thanks for your quick reply. can you be hired to make a plug-in like that? Maybe you donât have time. Hi, no I do not take commissions.</TEXT>

<TITLE>A Night In The Woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows A small cabin sits alone in a thunderstorm, surrounded by a dark empty forest. Awoken with a fright, J Doe stands to observe his surroundings. In the small little room a key is seen sitting atop a table. Equipped with the key, he finds the exit to the room. Unlocking the door he adventures down and begins his journey to escape. Walking through the dark empty cabin he comes across the exit. Using the key to unlock the door he finds himself back to where he started. In the little room, a table is set to the side with single light flickering above. The key is seen, shifting forms from a key to a ruin. Picking up the ruin/key, he journeys back through the cabin once again. Only this time the very world around him has changed. Shadows have shifted into shapes and objects have morphed into creatures. The further down he journeys, the more insane his mind is becoming. Finding himself back at the exit, he unlocks the door once again. Only to appear back to the little dark room. Facing the mirror with the key set in his hand, he begins raising the key to his head, unlocking his mind to escape the truth. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. COOL</TEXT>

One day, while walking through the park, he notices a group of young children playing carelessly with extremely rare cards worth thousands of dollars. Teenager realizes that the children have no idea how valuable those cards truly are. He canât just walk away, not when he knows those cards will still be lying around tomorrow, waiting for the kids to pick them up. The thought of money, the prestige, and the games he could win with those cards becomes too much for him to handle. That night, with only a flashlight, he sneaks back into the park to find these 8 cards. But little does he know—thereâs a reason no one dares enter the park after dark. --------------------------------------------------- Features: --------------------------------------------------- Controls: WASD - Movement E - Pick Up card Shift - Sprint C - Crouch F - Flashlight --------------------------------------------------- Credits: Almost all sound effects: https://freesound.org/ Original "Monster" model created by Shedmon Game tester: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matas-abraÄinskas-025b38381 --------------------------------------------------- Made in Unreal Engine 4 Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. actually pretty good just wish that he would spawn more often and run faster..

<TITLE>One Last Night in the Woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game A dark one page tabletop RPG about being a camp counsellor on the last night of the summer when the apocalypse happens, intended for one or two sessions of play. It's a mechanically light game about watching campers you're responsible for die one by one as you try desperately and hopelessly to save them. This is the first project I've ever released, and I'm honestly just happy to have something done that I can call my own. I hope you play and enjoy! Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. A very cool game concept! I can definitely see some strong 10 Candles vibes from it, but with faster set up and execution. I especially love the idea of 8 physical objects for the campers and building emotional connections to them before the game begins. Excellently macabre. Still, I feel like more instruction on the GM's part would be useful. If the game is intended to happen over the course of one in-game night, the GM will need to keep up a constant number of threats to the campers, but that may end up feeling like overkill if pacing rules aren't clear enough and specific challenges to overcome (beyond the actual enemies chosen early on) aren't established. Maybe having the players need to roll to either fix a generator or call for help or some other doomed goal they need to strive for. Absolutely. I've been thinking about writing up a second sheet specifically for GM instructions and advice and tools. I'm probably gonna add that in within the next couple days, though I might get sidetracked I had a recent surgery. And absolutely intentional on the 10 candles vibe; it's a big inspiration. <3 Seriously thank you btw. I appreciate the feedback a lot. For sure, gotta help out fellow devs after all, lol. And rest up! I know how it can be after a surgery. Will be excited to see what further updates you may make.</TEXT>

<TITLE>One More Night in the Woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Return to Possum Springs 5 years after Night in the Woods in this fan made visual novel! See what's happened to the town and the characters in the aftermath of the cult incident. Maybe smooch some furry girls. UPDATE VERSION 0.0.2: Originally forked from After the fall, but assets from that project have been removed and only similar story beats remain, though rewritten. This project is no longer in development. This page is only being left for preservation purposes. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Is this based off Light in the Woods? Yeah Hello! I recently got into NITW as of recent and I REALLY love how this game is turning out so far! I was interested in this game since it seems to not only be one of the very few NITW fangames out there but the art style looks similar to LITW, which I really loved the demo of when I played it! I haven't played through the entirety of this demo so far but I've noticed the music might of broke when loading up the game. Rebooting the game also seems to do nothing for the music neither :( Hopefully you are able to find the time to fix this issue along with also being able to get the rest of the game wrapped up! Game development is a huge hassle. Cannot wait to see the full release when it comes out! I'm glad you're enjoying the demo! Since it's so early in development, there is no music. This whole thing was just a side project I built from the open source parts of other NITW VNs. I will return to work on this game soon. Sweet! It just looked like there was music from the options in the settings and ofc the AtF soundtrack in the files. That brings up another question though, are the artists and writers from the other VN's helping you work on this VN too? Or are you a one person team? Either way, sending you my best regards for the future of this VN and your other projects! It's mostly just me with some help from the original AtF writer. I have some new art from friends to put in the next update too. Oh sweet! I was hoping you weren't alone. It would definitely be a LOT of work for one person. I have a lot more questions but i think I will hold off until the next update just because this thread is going to be miles long thanks to me LOL. Anywho, here is to hoping work goes smoothly for you and the team! <3 may we have the option to select skin for immersion pretty please? I never really paid much attention to the community around Nit in the Whoops, but the game itself is really cute and I don't hate it. I hope you had fun making this VN. I often keep to myself in real life and don't have many friends. Visual Novels are beautiful to me. Mods, forcer this individual to add a stupid out of lore option for what you still have some snow on (skin) got me feeling like after a full course meal in a thursday afternoon I respect you a lot and this is why Iâm going to be honest with you. I played After the Fall and you copied a lot of stuff from them (Iâm not talking about the art, I know those are public assets) From seeing Selmers at the cafe, meeting Gregg and Stan at the same time, Meeting Lori on the bus, Mae being terrified of you during your first meeting, from inheriting a home from your now presumably deceased father, the church scene where Mae bugs her parents at church because you make her uncomfortable (even copying the Pastorâs name), dinner at Maeâs with the weird floating head painting after returning her wallet (and even the conversation where Lori and Mae are seemingly dating)…. I could go on. All of that is from After the fall/Love in the woods. Itâs not a good look, especially after you landed yourself in hot water when they claimed you stole assets (even though you didnât). The writing is in the same boat as the art. After the Fall started off as a community version of Love in the Woods. It was created specifically because Love in the Woods would not share assets with the community. According to the original creator of AtF, anybody should be allowed to use and modify the contents of After the Fall and create their own versions, which is what I did. I wasn't satisfied with the direction and progress of After the Fall, so I made what I consider an improved version of it. "It's not a good look" is a meaningless derogative that people use when they just want to pick a side based on their feelings without considering facts. I use AtF content in accordance with their licensing terms, plain and simple. Anybody can see for themselves that AtF is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial Sharealike 3.0, listed in the credits of the game they've been distributing for years, but the current devs are claiming ignorance and lying to people to protect their own interests. If the current AtF developers wanted to keep their project closed off, they should have made their own version from the ground up instead of taking a free and open source game. The fact that they took control of a project and failed to understand how the licensing on it works is frankly embarrassing, indefensible, and on some level illegal. Both the main artist and main writer, who no longer work on the projects but were instrumental in getting them off the ground, have called out AtF and LITW on their bullshit and given me their blessing to continue this project. I've been ravenous for more NITW content and I absolutely adore the art style of the characters, feels similar to the original game yet different but still lovely looking. Definitely gonna be staying tuned for more updates, thank you for making this! (btw anyone know who the artist is? Unless it's the author codanon?) The artists are listed in the about section on the main menu. EquestriaPrevails (aka GoatAnimeDatingSim) made the character designs and drew the title art and most of the character sprites. I think Angus and some of Gregg's sprites as well as a lot of the backgrounds were done my Tymime. Thank you!~ Really enjoyable demo! Looking forward to seeing this project develop. I hope THIS nitw vn fan project will actually have some work put into it! It's looking really good so far! Well someone finally did it. Thank you based I love this :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Thief in the woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game This is a Werewolf inspired game with a theme of a thief in the woods. This is a university project that can now be played by anyone providing fun and enjoyment. The rules: This game has a minimum of 4 players and a maximum of 8, if you have a party of 4, only play with the special cards (cultists, Mae, Aunt Molly and Bea), for every extra player after that add a civilian card. To set up the game the party must select a "narrator" (a player that will tell the players what to do and when to ensure that no one cheats), this player shall then set up all the item cards around the playing zone so that all players have access to cards. The narrator then delivers the cards, some of them have special abilities. Mae- this role's objective is to take five cards from the playing zone, she can do this at night, whenever her turn comes. Bea- Whoever is assigned this card must get arrested to make sure that Mae is free. She has to trick the other player into thinking she is the thief. Aunt Molly- This character's sole purpose is finding Mae or the cultists, she can accuse a player of being a tief/kidnaper. If she gets it right then she wins. If not, the game will end and Mae/Bea or the cultists will win. Cultists- these people need to kidnap people every two rounds to ensure that the town doesn't crumble, every night they will have a chance to kidnap a player by touching them. During this phase, players must be listening in to make sure they find out who the cultist is. These people only win if the cop (Aunt Molly) is kidnapped, so that they have free reign over the people. The narrator must control the game, first giving the players 2 minutes to discuss and then beginning the night phase, with some time for Mae to steal followed by some time for the cultists to kidnap. While one of these rounds is taking place, all other players must keep their eyes closed. These rounds repeat until Mae gets 5 cards, Bea gets arrested, the kidnapper gets Aunt Molly or Aunt Molly arests the right person. Credits: Kai Mourato Aurea BillRehpiC Download the files and print the cards, with the front and back as a two side card. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Nice art!</TEXT>

<TITLE>A Knight in the Woods [Trijam 255]</TITLE>
<TEXT>The king demands that all his knight prove their courage by spending a single night in the kingdom's haunted woods. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the Knight. Use the mouse button to fire at mobs. Press 1 to select a heavy-hitting hammer. Press 2 for a fast sword. Collect fire to power your light. Use mouse scroll to zoom in on the action or scroll out to find fires nearby. This is my first time using URP, so it took way more time than 3 hours, but I decided that since I was already over the three hours, I wanted a game with fewer flaws than I normally would have for a Trijam submission. Version 1.2 saw the resolution increase to 800px square. Fires can now be picked up to add fuel to your light. The blobs now have speed-up mechanics to prevent running away tactics. The voting for Trjam 255 has finished, and the game came 12th out of 50; I got a lot of great feedback. Version 1.3 has two weapon choices and a new green mob swarm. Zoom in and out. All game design, tree and grass tile images, and animation by Stealthness Music Inspiring Cinematic Ambient by Lexin_music from Pixabay Knight, Creatures and Fire from 16x16 Dungeon Tileset Sound FX from Pixabay The game was made with Unity with Visual Studio, images were created and edited using Piskel and Photoshop, and the sound was edited with Audacity.

<TITLE>Diorama - A Quiet Night</TITLE>
<TEXT>An attempt to replicate this: https://www.behance.net/gallery/45540637/Low-poly-Camp Useful Resources For the skybox, two tutorials by Jannik Boysen and Tim Coster were handy. The moon is a little buggy because of the orthographic camera, but aside from that it looks nice. For the smoke effect, I took some inspiration from Gabriel Aguiar , specifically the idea of using Voronoi noise + alpha clipping to give the smoke some transparency. The fire look itself was based on: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g1qnQ Finally two tutorials by LMHPOLY and Brackeys were useful for understanding lighting and postprocessing effects.

This game finishes when it reboots by the way please don't keep playing it over and over. Thanks! *Game has been updated to version 1.1 which added some bug fixes *Game has been updated to version 1.2 which fixed some bugs and made the game more enjoyable Sorry for any gameplay issues I will do my best to fix them (please give the browser version lots of time to load.

Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. cool game COmments below clip; Fun little game! Had a great time playing and editing this one! I can't get enough of these PS1-style horror games. Keep it up! Good atmosphere, too short but maybe you could do it part 2 or something, screams were LOUD, and fantastic visuals fits horror really well. Good job As a indie dev i have question: How did you manage to get so many comments(and views probably)? thanks for the feedback. I am always learning from what I make and honestly I put out these games not because of there gameplay because honestly I suck at gameplay but mainly because I just want to showcase what I have learned no matter how good or bad it is. Iâm really not sure how I got so many views and comments on this and to be honest I donât think this game deserves the hype. I recommend making horror games in a old fashioned style they seem to be very popular on itch.io.. not bad. It is very short but the game was still playable. good job Another update - just added 1.2 which fixed bugs and made the game more enjoyable good unplayable can you tell me what the problem was I cannot play this on browser, It just showing a grey screen after unity load because itâs a big game you want to give it time to load. It shows the box for me but eventually it loads the game. Just wanted to let everyone know I just updated the game to improve playability as well as to fix some bugs this game was short but was creepy at some points I also jumped at some point really good excuse me! Is this game scary? It shouldn't be difficult! Creepy. Good short game liked it good jobð very enjoyable experience! keep it going developer! Good game. Good game!

<TITLE>Lost Constellation</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux Lost Constellation is a Night In The Woods ghost story. Travel into the frozen woods in a folktale from the world of Night In The Woods. It was made by Alec Holowka, Scott Benson, and Bethany Hockenberry in the last weeks of 2014. This is a supplemental game, which is to say it's not a demo or a preview of Night In The Woods. In some ways Lost Constellation is a lot like NITW, but in a lot of ways it's not. It's a tangent, a side-story, a way for us to explore a bit in a more off-the-cuff manner. We hope you love it!

<TITLE>'Possum Springs' - Acoustic Garden Cover</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable soundtrack Hii! This is a one-take cover of "Possum Springs" from "Night in the Woods", using my voice and a guitar, while touching grass. Incredible huh? NITW is a game that I really love. Not only did I have a lot of good moments playing it- tears of laugh and emotion, but it also teached me very important things about life. I feel like it influenced a lot in the way I interact with people; it basically gave me a lesson about humans: we are amazing, the world is full of beautiful individuals made of love. So, given the chance to cover a videogame, I decided to go with it. NITW has one of my favorite OSTs. There's so much love in its music that I want to cry of joy everytime I listen to it. I'm on a vacation and don't have the tools I usually use to make music, so I decided to try something different. I thought "what if I used my voice and a guitar as the main instruments?". And I did. The thing is, I'm not a very good guitar player, I don't have a lot of experience playing it. The way I learned to was by playing random stuff I enjoyed, sometimes by ear, sometimes searching for the chords on the internet. So yeah, don't expect some amazing playing, just a teen having a good time in a patagonic garden (â¿â â¿â ) I learned a lot in the process of making this, so I'm very happy for submitting something ^ ^ Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

How did you achieve the PS1-style graphics? Did you use the HPSX Render Pipeline? Or did you use the render texture + orthographic camera trick? Hi, I used a simple custom post-processing shader which downgrades the image resolution. I LOVED THE ATMOSPHERE. IT'S A GOOD CONCEPT. IT JUST FELT A LITTLE BIT RUSHED. THAT BEING SAID, I HAD FUN AND WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD WITH THE ENDING. WELL DONE! I wasn't expecting it to be so open and vast for such a small download! Really well done! Love the design of the monster too! Your game is at 14:15 Loved it, good job! That Game Was Awesome... Keep Its Up... Gave it a little lets play, disappointing ending, but initially comical but 'sorta spooky' monster by the noises Comments below the clip; Although an indie horror game with an incredible small footprint [37Mb], it lets you run through various snow-filled lanes, trying to stay ahead of a humanoid monster, that let's you know its presence by producing a sound that I can't really place, but it fits the atmo of this game to a tee. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it, and, if you are into these kinda games, highly recommend giving it a shot. Kudos to all involved. You made a great little game. This was a very short but fun game, good work :) Loved it. That jumpscare legitimately got me at the most unexpected moment XD sweet fun short game dev That was a good game but the ending major sad face. COOL SCARY The game surprised me at the end. The game is great Short but sweet. Great experience. </TEXT>

<TITLE>My Hotel in the woods: First Night</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows As your life in the big city becomes too stressful you grab your belongings and buy a rundown hotel in the middle of nowhere in an attempt to start a new life. As your first night in your new home begins you start to realize that, maybe there was a reason this place was so cheap... Become the owner of a shabby looking hotel in the woods. Prepare rooms, serve strange guests and clean in order to progress. "My Hotel in the woods - First Night" is a Horror exploration experience with light puzzle elements. Playtime: Around 10-20 Minutes My Hotel in the woods - First Night is a short game I created with the help of Unknown User and RubyLullaby for around two months on weekends. It is mostly a project to get back into game making and practise different creative skills. This game was originally meant to be much bigger but I scaled it down a lot during developement as to not lose interest in the project. I might return to this to make it more of a full experience with multiple days (I originally planned a full week) and with a lot more different guests and a bigger hotel with new areas.

So interesting and unique. Very good horror elements. You NEED to keep doing things like this my guy. Honestly thank you so much. You don't know how much those kind words mean to me <3 Fun game, but yes, needs tobe a little lighter if possible .. you have done an excellent job. Thank you! Thank you for playing! I didn't plan to make any more updates on this game, but I might do a small patch that fixes up the lighting a little bit by adding a faint glow around the player. Thanks for your reply. You don't need to do anything after all. I found that if I turn off the lights, it makes it easier to see. My eyesight is kinda wonky anyway due to very bad vision problems. So thank you anyway, and best of luck! :) great jobs :D Thank you so much for playing <3 I hope you enjoyed your time with it! wait for second night in hotel :P Very dark wish We could see maybe it was on purpose but so scary... Hey! Thanks for playing! Do you think the game should be a little brighter? Spooky game from the spooky German. Thank you for playing <3</TEXT>

<TITLE>Meep in the Woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>...Survival/Idle/Atmospheric Strategy-lite game created for the Fireside Jam 2023. You play as a guiding presence to 3 Meep. The meep are simple yet mysterious creatures that you bestow with new knowledge and guide towards fuel for their fire. Camera WASD for movement, Q and E for rotation. Mouse LMB to interact with meep Z - toggle torch A meep explodes if it is in the darkness for 6 consecutive seconds. If the campfire runs out of firewood, the chances of survival lower significantly. Keep the campfire alive by teaching the meep how to refuel it, and how to restock the pile of firewood. While the campfire burns, you gain points over time. Firewood can be discovered using the torch Click on the meep to access a small menu where you can use your points to bestow knowledge of a new task. Either 5 points for refueling a fire, or 15 for gathering firewood. Programming, Art and Audio created by Rooksy. The game is written in the Godot Engine. v. 3.5.2 Audio is all created with Beepbox. Art drawn in Aseprite. External Public Assets used: SFX: Stormy Wind In Forest / personal license under www.epidemicsound.com SFX: Campfire Crackling / courtesy of www.pixabay.com initial concept art The game was originally meant to be made in 2d isometric, but the programming overhead proved itself to be too time costly. Godot 4 was initially used for the 3D version of the game, but HTML5 web builds aren't supported yet for this sort of project. The core gameplay loop was not found until late in development. The first half of the week was spent tinkering with the visual and auditory experience. Once the genre of gameplay and core loop was picked, it became difficult to scope small enough for a realistic timeframe. Given more time there could have been many more additions to the game, such as modifying the meeps more, perks, meep interaction and teamwork, and the creation of new meep that could be customly sculpted. The theme Guide was in theory very fitting, but in practice it became difficult to balance how much autonomy you wanted to give the meep compared to how much "control" the player could have. Should you be able to directly move them? Tell them what to do? I feel the game could have leaned more onto the strategy Rimworld-esque genre with task priorities and more control over the meep. The game could also have moved more over to the horror genre, given some scarier sounds, and perhaps hostile entities the meep would have to be defended from. In the end, the resulting game became a cute prototype. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>A Walk in the Woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux In a fit of boredom you decided to walk around the small nature park near where you live, but walking around in the middle of the night can be quite unnerving. A Small Atmospheric Horror game With a PSX Art Style about walking around in the woods in the middle of the night. Also my first completed game!

This was scary as heck!! The ambient alone are enough to make me panic the whole times!!! ð±ð± (Malaysia) This video was supposed to come out a while ago as a part of something more but I'm super lazy. I actually really liked the game, I was on edge the whole time, expecting something to jump out and I'm not sure if I was disappointed nothing happened or not. So here's 3 minutes of me getting scared super easily, Put your game in a video I made. the atmosphere was good, honestly was expecting something to come and end me the whole time. Hope you enjoy the video! Hey, I featured your game in my latest Itch.io Horror Games video! The part with your game starts around 3:31! Hope ya enjoy! This games atmosphere was super creepy and the noises had me jumping a ton lol Even I, the trained boy scout, wouldn't camp in these woods! This is the second game in the video! I wish there were more to this! Great atmospheric game! Here's my playthrough: It's cool that's the game is under only 50mb, not much of action but was a nice stroll :) Not much to the game. BIG SMOKE CALLED ME IN THE WOODS. The game was decent enough for how long it was. While most of the creepiness was lost on me (minus the footsteps), it is a nice atmospheric game. Here's my channel for other games I have played. http://www.youtube.com/c/Levont The Game was honesty just kinda creepy because of the noises tbh. Lmao Good Game I like it :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>A Simple Walk in the Woods</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game You (or you and a friend) decided to go for a stroll through the woods one sunny, autumn day. You have heard of rumors of the forest being…odd but you brush them off as nonsense children and elders like to talk about in their boredom. After a few hours, you feel a sense of drowsiness and decide to take a nap next to a large oak tree that sits in a small clearing. You are suddenly awakened to find yourself still under the tree, but the sun has set. The full moon shining brightly, illuminating the forest in a brilliant light. As you look around, you find yourself unsure of where you came from, the pathway to the tree you took earlier is gone too! Utterly lost, you have no choice but to walk through the woods in the middle of the night to find a way out. Inspired by Within the House. Created by Christine Prevas (please go and try their game, itâs amazing) TTRPG GM-Less, Journaling Adventure for Solo Play or Two People For the Finally Finish Something 2022 Game Jam This is an experimental TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing game) as I want to make games that inspire writers and assist in plot prompts. So please let me know your thoughts and places where I could make improvements for other games. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Love this! A pure black and white version would be great for printing. Oh, thank you so much for the feedback and good idea. I just added a second file with the game in black and white. Enjoy the game :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Scouts Night Out</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows, macOS, and Linux It was supposed to be a campout just like any other. A young group of boys camping in the woods, enjoying life, enjoying nature. That was until it showed up. Now all you can do is run. Created as a final project for CSCI 477: Elements of Games and Game Development, Colorado School of Mines, Spring 2022 Windows : We are aware that some anti-virus software will render a false-positive on the game, this is a GameMaker wide issue (see https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031016592-What-to-do-if-your-gam... ) and we are looking into fixes but we cannot guarantee fixes. Mac : The game WILL NOT run outside the applications folder, so please drag and drop the app into there! This also seems to be something weird with GameMaker but we will try and see if there are solutions! Linux : This is very easy, just run the game or run it from terminal!

<TITLE>TIC: Tricolour Illumination Conduits</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows This is a very short puzzle game showing a new mechanic I developed based around covering a board with light cast out from a limited set of directional beams. It starts off very easy but some of the later levels can become kind of tricky. TIC is the first game I've ever completed and for that reason alone I am already incredibly proud. Feedback is very appreciated however I already feel like I've spent too much time on this project so don't hold your breath for updates. I'm not confident that all of the puzzle potential has been achieved from this idea but at this point, I don't have the puzzle creation skills to make anything more complex. There is a level editor though! If you take a stab at making any levels please copy your level codes and share them here in the comments. I would absolutely love to see what you can come up with! Thank you for taking a look at my game, for even that simple act I'm already grateful. If you would like to see any of my future games, check a look at my twitter @bendolyne! P.S. When downloading the game to get it for free , please click the obnoxiously greyed out " No thanks, just take me to the downloads " button above the price box.

The game itself is super simple, but the little details like the music picking up intensity as your health drops, and the effects when you get hit are phenomenal . I would've probably slowed down how quickly the difficulty ramps up, and some greater enemy variety would be nice. But again, excellent job on those effects.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Pulsoids (Oric)</TITLE>
<TEXT>A downloadable game for Windows The game is designed to run on 48KB Oric computers (such as Oric Atmos and Telestrat models), but the download link comes with a pre-configured Windows Emulator ready to run the English floppy version of the game. In addition, the "Game" folder contains a French floppy version as well as an English tape version. The game supports the PASE/ALTAI joystick interfaces. This game was created by Twilighte. Testing by Jede, Romu, Lothlin, Dbug PULSOIDS is an arcade game for one or two players (Alternating). Each player must clear the screen of tiles by deflecting pulsoids (Energy pulses) off their energy mirror (Bat). Each player starts with one pulse. However, Aliens also play in this arena, entering from the eye at the top of the screen. If a pulsoid collides with it, the alien will be destroyed and the Pulsoid will split into two. Bonuses also fall for some tiles that are destroyed. Collect them to earn extra power-ups and increase your score. Disc Users Insert the PULSOIDS disc into Drive A and reboot the Oric. Cassette Users Reboot the Oric, and at the command prompt type CLOAD"" Whilst in the Title screen... Press P to select between four different controls... Press G to Select the number of players. For a Two player game, Player A will begin first, and after they lose a life, the other Player will begin. Press M to switch the Music/Sound on or Off. Press D for the difficulty. The Difficulty relates to the speed of game play. Press I for instructions. The Instructions will scroll upwards and may be sped up by tapping P once. Tap P again and the Instructions will resume their normal speed. Hold P key down to pause the Scrolling. Press H to view both Halls of Fame and Shame. The Hall of Shame is populated when the Hall of Fame becomes full. Press Fire (The currently selected Fire Key or Joystick button) to begin play. During the game, Press DEL to Pause the game and ESC to Exit (In both instances, You will be given on-screen instructions how to proceed). During the game, use the left and right keys to move your energy mirror. In further levels, you may pick up a Bonus that gives you a Plasma Barrier at the base of the screen. This will deflect any Pulsoids so long as Fire is held down. However, the plasma barrier will last for a short time, and is dependant on period of activity. The Plasma barrier may be carried across levels. Once a game is over (And the other player has also died), you will be given the opportunity to enter your name in the High score tables. You will also be given your position in the tables. For further information and hints, turn to the in-game Instructions. Click download now to get access to the following files: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. looks awesome! It does indeed! I think Pulsoids is the first game Twilighte made that really nailed it in term of balance between the playability, the technical achievement and how it sounded and looked. Which reminds me, I forgot to add a link to a video of the game in action!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Controls/Rules: Click to generate a beam circle, stop clicking to remove all animals in the circle (circle has max size) Collect X/X cows to win (in bottom right) before you run out of energy Do not collect sheep (you'll lose) Each fox you collect will allow the safe collection of one sheep Press R to restart a level at any time Note: Progress is not saved when the game is closed. Known Bug: DO NOT click directly onto animals to create a beam circle, the animal will not disappear, this is not intentional. (I'll fix it later I swear) another known bug *sigh* : Winning the level while simultaneously getting a sheep should end in defeat, it ends in victory. (try not to cheat ig, if you're sure you got a sheep, reset... or y'know do whatever lol) There are 9 levels in total, some easier then others (I'm sorry for what I did for level 2, forgive me). Good luck, and enjoy! This game was created entirely in 4 days as a solo project for the 2025 GMTK game jam.

<TEXT>A downloadable game DISCLAIMER: Proto-type game for educational purposes. Space to fire, wasd/arrow keys for movement, E to spawn turret. Ice is covering the world, and the Frozen Legion is on a quest to extinguish all the flame and heat in the world. Stand against the un-ending frozen blight headed your way; or feel the cold grasp of death. This is basically a line-defense game, but the lines are not clearly distinguised. Enemies will keep spawning from the right-side of the screen and head to the left. Stop them; for if they get past, you will lose life until you die and need to restart. You can spawn camp fires which shoot straight in front of them. These will slow down their rate of fire as time passes; but you can refresh and empower their speed by shooting at them; or have another camp fires fire at it. Currently camp fires have no cost, and no collision; so you can stack them. In a potential future version of this, it will cost heat (your score) to build these camp fires. Things to include before it can be more than a proto-type: - Change the code to not be so reliant on 60FPS to function properly - Add in sounds and music - Main menu and score screen A short test game for educational purposes of the creator. It includes basic movement, raycasting, prefabs, fps-based updating code. Run at 60-FPS. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>GARDENING</TITLE>
<TEXT>A simple game I made to try and get to grips with Voxatron . I'm so, so glad I finally managed to get into this, after it inspired me so much in its early years but I found the development tools a bit difficult to figure out (even quite recently!). Having since bought in heavily to PICO-8 and made some 40 games with it, I decided to come back around and make a proper go of it when Voxatron 0.3.5 hit, and I'm really happy that I did. This is entirely programmed in one script inside the main room, with one (short and boring) tune in the background. No precreated assets or anything like that. Which might make it interesting for you to explore! Anyway here's my silly game about being a weird gardening alien with a weird ship in a weird garden that has a bottomless pit in the middle. You have to clear all those nasty rocks out!!! (in menu) Z: start game (in game) Z [hold]: activate tractor beam to suck up rocks under your ship X [tap]: dump a rock, ideally into the pit (in 'all done' screen) Z + X together [tap]: back to title When you've dumped all the rocks into the pit, you'll get a nice 'all done' screen and an opportunity to replay. That's it! Have fun messing around in this little world! And never forget: you can make games like this too!!! I'll help any way I can!!! Lexaloffle BBS thread/alternative game hosting: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=33094 #onegameamonth January 2019 It seems like you can only export Voxatron games as carts (PNG files) for now - you can safely download and run this game if you own Voxatron, either through SPLORE (id: ix_gardening) or by grabbing the PNG file here. I provided a HTML page with just the embed code in it, which should work if you're connected to the internet. Alternatively, you should be able to play it via HTML in the browser at https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=33094 Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.</TEXT>

<TITLE>Beams and Flowers</TITLE>
<TEXT>Make your way through all checkpoints and destroy all the poisonous flowers (they were supposed to be viruses but apparently some people don't want to hear about those ...) Controls: Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. Nicely crafted puzzles! I need some help with the last one. Do you need â£ to kill both the upper flower AND the laser next to the rust patch? If so, I can't see how No, the laser next to the rusty floor can be destroyed with â¤ Thanks, finally got it. Really enjoyed the game! Nice one! The last run of levels is really terrific. I particularly enjoyed 16, which very nearly defeated me :) Glad you liked it ! 16 is my favourite too. Always a bit afraid that someone finds an easy solution to a supposedly hard level. I might create more levels later, but I'm still not sure which difficulty I should aim for. I think even if 16 ends up having unintended solutions, they'd be so complicated that they might as well be official! I definitely prefer levels that are concept or insight driven, which force you into taking a step back to look at what the level is asking you to do and what interactions of mechanics that might involve. The last three are very much in that category, and force you away from the sort of fingertip aha moments that you get when you're just pottering around the level seeing what's what. Even so, it's always worth trying to avoid the harrowing effect (at least in linear puzzlescript games) where each level feels impossible, takes everything you have, and then the next one seems even harder :)</TEXT>

<TITLE>Beams and Flowers 2</TITLE>
<TEXT>A challenging puzzle with blocks, lasers, mirrors ... Revamped version of Beams and Flowers with auroriax fork of Puzzlescript. 40 levels including the tutorial. Keyboard control : arrow keys to move, X or space for action, Z to undo, R to restart, Esc for level select. Mouse control: drag the robot, left click on the same row or column to trigger an action in that direction. Log in with itch.io to leave a comment. The puzzles are quite nice, but I would prefer a more responsive movement system where if you hit the left arrow key you move left immediately rather than having to turn left then press it again. Also the undo key doesn't seem to undo block pushes? It just undoes movement You might want to just face another direction to do an action without actually moving (into a laser beam or a crumbling floor tile for instance), so it is needed. You might like the mouse control more, though you have to be careful. A mix of both does work. The undo key does undo block pushes but also any other move for the same reason (it also works if you're accidentally hit by a laser beam and die). Great puzzles, but the action button is not rotating the mirrors for me. I tried reloading it, but x and space still seem to do nothing. The robot must be in the right direction on the same row or column, 'looking' at the object (it does it automatically with mouse controls). Also there must be no obstacles (like walls, blocks, ...). And only the red mirrors can rotate. Ah, silly me. I missed that part of the tutorial. Thanks! No problem, do not hesitate to ask if you're stuck or to report any strange behaviour. It's always possible to go back to the specific tutorial to check and experiment.</TEXT>
