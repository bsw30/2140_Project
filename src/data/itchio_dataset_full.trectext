Imagine being the only survivor of an explosion that kills thousands of people. That is the fate of Sofya Rykov. And survival is just the beginning of her tale...

This installment serves as an introduction to players new to the series and provide important backstory to players who enjoyed Echoes of the Fey Episode 1: The Fox's Trail , already released on Steam.

An officer in the Imperial Army, Sofya is tasked with guarding Leshin prisoners at Onigrad, a city which will soon become famous for its fiery destruction. In the last days of the long war between Humans and Leshin, a tense stalemate emerges amidst the chaos. For years, Leshin have lain siege to the Humans over their use of Fey reactors, massive machines that draw electricity from the realm of magic. Both sides tire after almost thirty years of war, and perhaps peace is now in reach. But Leshin extremists, desperate for a victory to reclaim their power among the people, are about to stage a devastating attack that will change the world forever. Echoes of the Fey is a series of detective stories set in the high fantasy world of Oraz. Episode 0: The Immolation takes place before the protagonist, Sofya Rykov, becomes a private investigator. She is an officer in the Imperial Human army who believes she has secured a safe position as a prison guard in the metropolitan city of Onigrad. One fateful night, one of the Leshin assigned to her begins to act strangely. And then a massive boom rings out from the Onigrad Fey reactor... Episode 0 is an adventure game/visual novel with dialog trees and several choices for Sofya that will affect the way the story plays out. Sofya will also be able to explore the prison and learn more about the world from her prisoners, though with an impending disaster about to hit the prison, she will have to balance how to use her time before staging her escape.

<TEXT>
**FULL GAME NOW RELEASED!** The Echoes of the Fey series mixes a high fantasy setting with the mysteries and conspiracies of pulp detective fiction. Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she is the only Human able to wield unlimited magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot. Developed in Unreal Engine 4, The Last Sacrament forms the next installment of the ongoing series. Sofyaâs loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofyaâs childhood love and the Emperorâs daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerinaâs rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city—and Sofyaâs heart. Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofyaâs life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story. You can also pursue romances with four different characters in The Last Sacrament: Heremon, Arkady, Nikolai, or Katerina. -------------------------------------------------- Recommended MINIMUM requirements on LOW settings: Microsoft Windows 7 or higher AMD 7500 or NVIDIA GT 555M video card 4GB RAM Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz 2 GB free hard drive space

Gameplay Echoes of the Architects is a real-time strategy game that rewards creativity, strategic depth, and adaptability. Victory lies in your ability to design and deploy customizable, programmable units to dominate the battlefield. At its heart is a robust unit customization system, letting you build armies tailored to your playstyle. Combine modules like locomotion systems, weapons, and repair tools, and define your unitsâ roles—whether gathering resources, defending key points, or executing precision strikes to outflank enemies. Battles are fast-paced and dynamic, demanding sharp strategic thinking and quick adaptation. With programmable units capable of executing complex maneuvers autonomously, you can focus on your tactics rather than high actions-per-minute gameplay. As you advance, unlock new modules, unit classes, and tactical options, continuously evolving your forces. Explore diverse planets, each with unique environments and challenges, as you expand the fight across the galaxy. In Echoes of the Architects, every decision matters.

Asynchronous Multiplayer : Enjoy stress-free gameplay with pausable battles and unlimited, always-on replayability Story The galaxy was ours to conquer—or so we believed. In our unyielding quest for dominance, humanity delved too deeply into the void, awakening a force beyond comprehension: the Architects. Silent, enigmatic, and devastatingly efficient, they seized our greatest creations—turning humanityâs own advanced technologies into instruments of annihilation. Entire worlds fell in mere moments, their skies darkened by the machines we once called progress. Now, you stand as one of the last sparks of resistance, seeking shelter on a scarred and broken Earth—a planet consumed by the wars and greed of its past. With only the remnants of human ingenuity at your disposal, you command the battlefield from a distance, deploying whatâs left of our scattered forces. Every battle is a desperate gamble, a flicker of hope against the Architectsâ impenetrable grip. But thereâs something more—whispers buried deep in the ruins of our shattered worlds. Clues that hint at the true nature of the Architects, their purpose, and why they were waiting for us to awaken them. Understanding them might be the key to victory—or a revelation too dangerous to confront. This is our last chance to reclaim the galaxy, dismantle the Architectsâ empire, and unearth the secrets of their origin. The final war begins, and humanityâs fate rests in your hands.

Echoes of the Future is an interactive fiction adventure written in Inform 6 using the PunyInform library, specially designed for 8-bit computers and retro systems such as the Commodore 64. Inspired by the classics of Infocom, this game invites you on a mysterious journey through time, with a slow-burning narrative that rewards curiosity, observation, and thoughtful reflection. In Echoes of the Future , the text is your map, and language is your tool. Reading carefully and thinking deeply are essential to progress. The story unfolds within an intimate and existential science fiction framework, structured in three chapters that gradually reveal unexpected connections between distant eras. The boundaries of time begin to blur, and what once seemed far away begins to echo within the present narrative. Available as a D64 image for Commodore 64 , ST disk image for Atari ST , DSK image for MSX, ZX Spectrum (CP/M required), and Amstrad CPC, floppy disk for MS-DOS , ADF disk image for Commodore Amiga , and now also as a GBA-compatible file for Game Boy Advance . A disk image for Acorn is also included (runs on the Acorn Ozmoo interpreter, currently in alpha) . You can run it on an emulator or transfer it to original hardware — simple instructions are included.  A version for Commander X16 is also available. The original Z-Machine .z5 file is also included, allowing the adventure to be played on any interpreter compatible with the Z-Machine format, such as Frotz (in the video, the adventure runs in Frotz on Linux inside a CoolRetroTerm terminal), Gargoyle, or Lectrote — making the story accessible on virtually any platform. Additionally, an HTML version is now available, so you can play the game instantly in your web browser without installing anything — just click and enjoy! The Official Solution is also available: Echoes of the Future: Chronicles of the Rebirth , now downloadable from the official section. Download it and dive into a story where time twists and every discovery echoes beyond its moment. Echoes of the Future is a journey that unfolds, word by word. Acknowledgements My heartfelt thanks to: Graham Nelson , for creating Inform 6 , the tool that made this adventure possible. Johan Berntsson and Fredrik Ramsberg , for their outstanding work on the PunyInform library, their invaluable technical support, and for developing the Ozmoo interpreter, which brings interactive fiction to life on classic systems like the Commodore 64. Shawn Sijnstra , for his excellent Vezza interpreter, enabling this story to run smoothly across a variety of retro platforms. Stefan Vogt , for his powerful Puny BuildTools , which greatly simplified the build and release process. Jade , for his dedication to testing, and for spotting the little things that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. And to everyone who, in one way or another, encouraged, helped, or inspired me throughout the development of Echoes of the Future . Thank you for believing in words, for traveling through time with me, and for keeping the magic of interactive fiction alive.

<TEXT>
Welcome to Echoes of the Broken — a tabletop roleplaying game of elemental mayhem in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Itâs been 100 years since the Breaking of the Gods, when the world of Ranaskar was devastated by an apocalyptic war between the gods. Falling from the heavens, the broken corpses of the gods became the Remnants — colossal, monolithic structures of arcane power. From the Remnants emanates the Echo, the will of the Broken Gods, twisted by their violent end. The Echo warps the land, and corrupts the people, leaving Ranaskar a volatile hellscape. Yet, some hope remains — Oros, the first to die. Numbered among the gods in a bygone era, Oros was betrayed and murdered by the other gods, their body torn asunder and scattered across the land. For thousands of years, the remains of Oros were dormant, mere curiosities to the mortals that lived their lives around them. Following the Breaking of the Gods, however, the Remnants of Oros came to life, projecting a warding shield to keep at bay the Echoes of the Broken Gods. Within these wards, the Sanctums of Oros, frightened mortals took refuge. Now, 100 years later, the Sanctums grow weak, ever besieged by the Echoes of the Broken Gods. In desperation, the Remnants of Oros have called upon champions — the Wardens. You are a Warden, plucked from the grasp of death and endowed with a fragment of Orosâs power, that you might stand against the Echoes of the Broken. Features An original system geared towards Narrative Agency, that keeps the fiction moving forward. An immersive character building experience. Worldbuilding tools to make each campaign of Echoes of the Broken your own. This game is in early access. While fully-playable, there is a lot more development and refinement to do.

<TEXT>
Two weeks ago the earth shifted outside a small town, slightly left of nowhere. It revealed the ruins of a forgotten city. People flocked to the ruins, eager to learn about the newly uncovered polis. Rumors flit about, that this could be a fabled city, thought by many to be nothing more than myth. Echoes of the Lost City is a game about two people - the CHRONICLER, a resident of the Lost City before its fall, who kept a record of their life and the goings on of their city, and the RESEARCHER hundreds of years in the future trying to uncover the truths about the Lost City through the Chroniclers' records. Together, players will label a dig site map and tell the story of the Lost City and its fall through the ancient accounts of the Chronicler and information found and interpreted by the Researcher. Played asynchronously between two people, Echoes of the Lost City is played by choosing locations on the dig site map and the CHRONICLER writing chronicle entries based in those locations. Then, the ravages of time will take effect on the chronicle and it is up to the RESEARCHER to decipher the information that has otherwise been lost to time. Will you be able to uncover the truth about the lost city? Or will it remain a myth forever? It is up to you. ****** If you enjoy this game, please tell me about it on Bluesky !

<TEXT>
ABOUT GAME 'Echoes of the dead' is a 2D roguelike platformer where players control Tanzo, a wizard on a quest for vengeance against the monsters that destroyed his village. The game features challenging projectile-based combat, requiring precision and strategy as Tanzo battles through hordes of enemies. Level is procedurally generated, ensuring a unique experience with every playthrough. As Tanzo delves deeper into the haunted landscapes, he faces increasingly powerful foes. DYNAMIC LEVEL DESIGN In 'Echoes of the dead' the level design revolves around procedural generation, ensuring that each playthrough offers a fresh and unpredictable experience. Every time a level restarts, either due to player death or level restarting, the environment completely changes—new enemy placements and layouts await. This dynamic design adds to the challenge, as no two runs are ever the same. If the player dies, they are sent back to the beginning, emphasizing the roguelike element and requiring them to master the game's mechanics and adapt to ever-changing levels. PROGRESSION To progress in 'Echoes of the dead' players must descend deeper into the game's treacherous levels, with the final boss waiting in the lowest floor. However, the deeper Tanzo goes, the tougher the enemies and challenges become. Itâs crucial to explore thoroughly, defeat enemies, and unlock all skills to strengthen Tanzo before facing the increasingly difficult foes that lurk in the depths. If you feel like you have lost your way, restart the level from pause menu.

You are returning to your solitary cabin after an unsuccessful hunt. The old, wild mountains have tested you before, but this night was different. The silence was broken by terrifying human screams coming from the direction of the abandoned cemetery—a place that even locals gave a wide berth.

Echoes of the Forest was an university project for summer term 22. The topic was "reflection" and the game should contain a graphical challenge. It was created by a team of 4 people. You should have a reasonably up-to-date  NVIDIA graphics card, anything else may cause artifacts in the game.

Basic Info Echoes Of The Past is a horror game in which you are a Paranormal investigator and you're trying to understand the story behind a lonely old mansion in the woods. New Update! The new Update has been now released! Have fun playing my game, remember, this is just a prototype, in future Updates the game might look different, stay tunned for more updates :) Patch Notes v0.0.2 #011723 -> Improved Post-Processing (WARNING! Do not play if your PC is not at least an average gaming PC, the game still doesn't have options so you can't turn the Post-Processing Off, that also means that some PC's might crash while playing); -> Improved performance : The v0.0.1 was a bit laggy because it was rendering all the grass in the world, now that does not happen anymore because I changed the way grass is rendered, this means that some PC's might have a little boost in performance; -> Improved Lightning : I changed some values in the game such as the fog and the flashlight so now the game looks much darker and better, it also helped doing the optimization for the grass; -> Improved grass : I changed the grass texture and now it looks more natural and blends in more with the rest of the forest, I will still try to make it better but I will probably just leave it like it is right now. -> More Trees : The v0.0.1 had 10000 Trees and now it has 25000, I know, Its a lot, and this was one of the worst but at the same time best ideas I've had, It ruins the game because now the game loads and renders 25000 trees but it also makes the game more realistic. Next Update Here is a list of what I will try to add to the game on v0.0.3 : -> Main Menu (Without Options Still, Options Maybe needs to be a single update, probably that's what coming on v0.0.4) -> Mansion Model on The map and also some other props I want to put in the forest -> Initial animation to explain the game's story

<URL>https://toribee.itch.io/echoes-of-the-labyrinth</URL>
<TEXT>
Concept : Echoes of the Labyrinth is a solo journaling TTRPG inspired by the novel " House of Leaves " by Mark Z. Danielewski using The Wretched game framework created by Chris Bissette. The player's character navigates an enigmatic, ever-changing house, attempting to understand its mystery, maintain sanity, and survive. Gameplay : The game is played with a deck of playing cards, a six-sided die, a Jenga tower, a journal, and tokens (scraps of paper) representing hope. The character's journey and experiences are documented through daily journal entries prompted by card draws. Prompt Tables : The game features four prompt tables themed after different elements: Architectural Changes, Unexplainable Phenomena, Psychological Struggles, and Discovery and Hope. Each card drawn corresponds to a specific prompt from these tables, creating unique, evolving gameplay. Endgame : The game ends when either the deck of cards is exhausted, indicating the character has survived and navigated the labyrinth for a considerable time, when the Jenga tower collapses, symbolizing a major catastrophe in the house, or when the player runs out of hope tokens, signifying complete hopelessness. Alternatively, the game can also end if the player finds an exit key and successfully escapes. Aim : The game's goal is not just survival but also crafting an engaging, immersive narrative about exploring the labyrinthine house and confronting its eerie phenomena and psychological challenges.

Game-play Styles Each style has you navigate the same world, interact with the same characters and complete the same interconnected quest. However, unique clues and secrets are hidden across the world. Characters will have different things to say, even on new loops of the same game-play style. Top Down - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Visual Novel - Controls with mouse,  WS or arrow keys, interact with E, shift or space bar. Platformer - Controls with AS or arrow keys, jump with W or up arrow key,  interact with E, shift or space bar. First Person - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, mouse to look around, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Echoes of the Rift was made in 4 days for the GMTK 25 Game Jam with the theme of "Loop". Why I decided to make 4 games instead of one nobody knows. Thanks for playing! You can find a video of me playing the game with commentary and revealing the locations of all the secrets here: Post-Jam Fixes Added music and sound effects Added return to menu button: Hold R for 3 seconds Fixed window scaling Fixed conditional dialogue, which was broken almost everywhere Rewrote most dialogue Made the action-y bits less fiddly Much more!

Echoes of the Past is a game made by 3  grade 7 students at Verdala International School in Malta. It was made for our IDU project in around 3-4 days. This game takes you to a future world, where you have to find remnants of Malta and watch the videos. The game has multiplayer, but it is not very good, as we were on a very tight deadline, although it should be functional. For some reason, the networking engine stopped working out of nowhere, but hopefully it works now. Screw you PUN2. Feel free to download and try our game out!

Dive into this apparently infinite dungeon, where there's no sign of external light and there are many things lurking in the shadows. Your lantern has the power of focusing light into a concentrated path, raising the temperature of everything it touches! Entry participation for Brackey's community 2023.2 Game Jam on August 2023. The theme was "Diving deeper" and even though that theme probably reminds you more of a subaquatic kind of game, I thought I could give it a spin by making it symbolize "diving"  into the darkness and "deeper" into an infinite dungeon. I had more ideas to better utilize the theme but they were scrapped due to the time limit (Game jam was 1 week). Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated!

For years, Leshin have lain siege to the Humans over their use of Fey reactors, massive machines that draw electricity from the realm of magic. Both sides tire after almost thirty years of war, and perhaps peace is now in reach. But Leshin extremists, desperate for a victory to reclaim their power among the people, are about to stage a devastating attack that will change the world forever.

<TEXT>
**FULL GAME NOW RELEASED!** The Echoes of the Fey series mixes a high fantasy setting with the mysteries and conspiracies of pulp detective fiction. Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she is the only Human able to wield unlimited magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot. Developed in Unreal Engine 4, The Last Sacrament forms the next installment of the ongoing series. Sofyaâs loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofyaâs childhood love and the Emperorâs daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerinaâs rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city—and Sofyaâs heart. Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofyaâs life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story. You can also pursue romances with four different characters in The Last Sacrament: Heremon, Arkady, Nikolai, or Katerina. -------------------------------------------------- Recommended MINIMUM requirements on LOW settings: Microsoft Windows 7 or higher AMD 7500 or NVIDIA GT 555M video card 4GB RAM Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz 2 GB free hard drive space

If you like the demo, don't forget to add the game to your Steam wishlist to stay updated on the full release! Gameplay Echoes of the Architects is a real-time strategy game that rewards creativity, strategic depth, and adaptability. Victory lies in your ability to design and deploy customizable, programmable units to dominate the battlefield. At its heart is a robust unit customization system, letting you build armies tailored to your playstyle. Combine modules like locomotion systems, weapons, and repair tools, and define your unitsâ roles—whether gathering resources, defending key points, or executing precision strikes to outflank enemies. Battles are fast-paced and dynamic, demanding sharp strategic thinking and quick adaptation. With programmable units capable of executing complex maneuvers autonomously, you can focus on your tactics rather than high actions-per-minute gameplay. As you advance, unlock new modules, unit classes, and tactical options, continuously evolving your forces. Explore diverse planets, each with unique environments and challenges, as you expand the fight across the galaxy. In Echoes of the Architects, every decision matters.

Asynchronous Multiplayer : Enjoy stress-free gameplay with pausable battles and unlimited, always-on replayability Story The galaxy was ours to conquer—or so we believed. In our unyielding quest for dominance, humanity delved too deeply into the void, awakening a force beyond comprehension: the Architects. Silent, enigmatic, and devastatingly efficient, they seized our greatest creations—turning humanityâs own advanced technologies into instruments of annihilation. Entire worlds fell in mere moments, their skies darkened by the machines we once called progress. Now, you stand as one of the last sparks of resistance, seeking shelter on a scarred and broken Earth—a planet consumed by the wars and greed of its past. With only the remnants of human ingenuity at your disposal, you command the battlefield from a distance, deploying whatâs left of our scattered forces. Every battle is a desperate gamble, a flicker of hope against the Architectsâ impenetrable grip. But thereâs something more—whispers buried deep in the ruins of our shattered worlds. Clues that hint at the true nature of the Architects, their purpose, and why they were waiting for us to awaken them. Understanding them might be the key to victory—or a revelation too dangerous to confront. This is our last chance to reclaim the galaxy, dismantle the Architectsâ empire, and unearth the secrets of their origin. The final war begins, and humanityâs fate rests in your hands.

Reading carefully and thinking deeply are essential to progress.

The original Z-Machine .z5 file is also included, allowing the adventure to be played on any interpreter compatible with the Z-Machine format, such as Frotz (in the video, the adventure runs in Frotz on Linux inside a CoolRetroTerm terminal), Gargoyle, or Lectrote — making the story accessible on virtually any platform. Additionally, an HTML version is now available, so you can play the game instantly in your web browser without installing anything — just click and enjoy!

Johan Berntsson and Fredrik Ramsberg , for their outstanding work on the PunyInform library, their invaluable technical support, and for developing the Ozmoo interpreter, which brings interactive fiction to life on classic systems like the Commodore 64. Shawn Sijnstra , for his excellent Vezza interpreter, enabling this story to run smoothly across a variety of retro platforms. Stefan Vogt , for his powerful Puny BuildTools , which greatly simplified the build and release process. Jade , for his dedication to testing, and for spotting the little things that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

<TEXT>
Welcome to Echoes of the Broken — a tabletop roleplaying game of elemental mayhem in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Itâs been 100 years since the Breaking of the Gods, when the world of Ranaskar was devastated by an apocalyptic war between the gods. Falling from the heavens, the broken corpses of the gods became the Remnants — colossal, monolithic structures of arcane power. From the Remnants emanates the Echo, the will of the Broken Gods, twisted by their violent end. The Echo warps the land, and corrupts the people, leaving Ranaskar a volatile hellscape. Yet, some hope remains — Oros, the first to die. Numbered among the gods in a bygone era, Oros was betrayed and murdered by the other gods, their body torn asunder and scattered across the land. For thousands of years, the remains of Oros were dormant, mere curiosities to the mortals that lived their lives around them. Following the Breaking of the Gods, however, the Remnants of Oros came to life, projecting a warding shield to keep at bay the Echoes of the Broken Gods. Within these wards, the Sanctums of Oros, frightened mortals took refuge. Now, 100 years later, the Sanctums grow weak, ever besieged by the Echoes of the Broken Gods. In desperation, the Remnants of Oros have called upon champions — the Wardens. You are a Warden, plucked from the grasp of death and endowed with a fragment of Orosâs power, that you might stand against the Echoes of the Broken. Features An original system geared towards Narrative Agency, that keeps the fiction moving forward. An immersive character building experience. Worldbuilding tools to make each campaign of Echoes of the Broken your own. This game is in early access. While fully-playable, there is a lot more development and refinement to do.

Two weeks ago the earth shifted outside a small town, slightly left of nowhere. It revealed the ruins of a forgotten city. People flocked to the ruins, eager to learn about the newly uncovered polis. Rumors flit about, that this could be a fabled city, thought by many to be nothing more than myth. Echoes of the Lost City is a game about two people - the CHRONICLER, a resident of the Lost City before its fall, who kept a record of their life and the goings on of their city, and the RESEARCHER hundreds of years in the future trying to uncover the truths about the Lost City through the Chroniclers' records. Together, players will label a dig site map and tell the story of the Lost City and its fall through the ancient accounts of the Chronicler and information found and interpreted by the Researcher. Played asynchronously between two people, Echoes of the Lost City is played by choosing locations on the dig site map and the CHRONICLER writing chronicle entries based in those locations. Then, the ravages of time will take effect on the chronicle and it is up to the RESEARCHER to decipher the information that has otherwise been lost to time. Will you be able to uncover the truth about the lost city? Or will it remain a myth forever? It is up to you. ****** If you enjoy this game, please tell me about it on Bluesky !

<TEXT>
ABOUT GAME 'Echoes of the dead' is a 2D roguelike platformer where players control Tanzo, a wizard on a quest for vengeance against the monsters that destroyed his village. The game features challenging projectile-based combat, requiring precision and strategy as Tanzo battles through hordes of enemies. Level is procedurally generated, ensuring a unique experience with every playthrough. As Tanzo delves deeper into the haunted landscapes, he faces increasingly powerful foes. DYNAMIC LEVEL DESIGN In 'Echoes of the dead' the level design revolves around procedural generation, ensuring that each playthrough offers a fresh and unpredictable experience. Every time a level restarts, either due to player death or level restarting, the environment completely changes—new enemy placements and layouts await. This dynamic design adds to the challenge, as no two runs are ever the same. If the player dies, they are sent back to the beginning, emphasizing the roguelike element and requiring them to master the game's mechanics and adapt to ever-changing levels. PROGRESSION To progress in 'Echoes of the dead' players must descend deeper into the game's treacherous levels, with the final boss waiting in the lowest floor. However, the deeper Tanzo goes, the tougher the enemies and challenges become. Itâs crucial to explore thoroughly, defeat enemies, and unlock all skills to strengthen Tanzo before facing the increasingly difficult foes that lurk in the depths. If you feel like you have lost your way, restart the level from pause menu.

<TEXT>
The daughter of the noble Frigidaque family has been kidnapped, and a ransom demanded: a valuable heirloom to be delivered by the family scion himself, Hiemantis. Not being a complete and total fool, Hiemantis hires two of the Guild's foremost mercenaries to escort him to the exchange, but none of them could have been prepared for where this adventure would lead them. Echoes of the Ethereal is a character-driven, fantasy RPG, with what is currently about an hour's worth of content. Join Hiemantis, Pratus, and Cora as they venture forth to deliver a ransom and find more than they expected. FEATURES: Random encounters! A dog that makes a barking noise when you interact with it! Elements! Elements just all up ins here! Siblings acting like siblings! People who aren't even related acting like siblings! The word bastard used both literally and metaphorically! Maybe don't play this with the kids unless you're ready for that conversation! Mostly wholesome otherwise, though! Exclamation points!!! If you encounter any issues with the game or just want to talk about it, you can find me on twitter @hotandcoldaf or e-mail me at thehotandcoldaf@gmail.com

Push into the future while avoiding dangers in the past. You control a ship with a quantum drive. You need to get through the event horizon but there is an asteroid belt in the way. Blast into the future and reach through the asteroids. But beware, your past self is still in real space and damage to it will reset the quantum drive, The further into the future you push, the longer your delay will be for dodging dangers. Use Left and Right Arrow Keys or A and D and let your quantum drive charge enough times to reach the top of the screen.

Echoes of the Forest was an university project for summer term 22. The topic was "reflection" and the game should contain a graphical challenge. It was created by a team of 4 people. You should have a reasonably up-to-date  NVIDIA graphics card, anything else may cause artifacts in the game.

Basic Info Echoes Of The Past is a horror game in which you are a Paranormal investigator and you're trying to understand the story behind a lonely old mansion in the woods. New Update! The new Update has been now released! Have fun playing my game, remember, this is just a prototype, in future Updates the game might look different, stay tunned for more updates :) Patch Notes v0.0.2 #011723 -> Improved Post-Processing (WARNING! Do not play if your PC is not at least an average gaming PC, the game still doesn't have options so you can't turn the Post-Processing Off, that also means that some PC's might crash while playing); -> Improved performance : The v0.0.1 was a bit laggy because it was rendering all the grass in the world, now that does not happen anymore because I changed the way grass is rendered, this means that some PC's might have a little boost in performance; -> Improved Lightning : I changed some values in the game such as the fog and the flashlight so now the game looks much darker and better, it also helped doing the optimization for the grass; -> Improved grass : I changed the grass texture and now it looks more natural and blends in more with the rest of the forest, I will still try to make it better but I will probably just leave it like it is right now. -> More Trees : The v0.0.1 had 10000 Trees and now it has 25000, I know, Its a lot, and this was one of the worst but at the same time best ideas I've had, It ruins the game because now the game loads and renders 25000 trees but it also makes the game more realistic. Next Update Here is a list of what I will try to add to the game on v0.0.3 : -> Main Menu (Without Options Still, Options Maybe needs to be a single update, probably that's what coming on v0.0.4) -> Mansion Model on The map and also some other props I want to put in the forest -> Initial animation to explain the game's story

<TITLE>Echoes of the Labyrinth</TITLE>

<URL>https://toribee.itch.io/echoes-of-the-labyrinth</URL>
<TEXT>
Concept : Echoes of the Labyrinth is a solo journaling TTRPG inspired by the novel " House of Leaves " by Mark Z. Danielewski using The Wretched game framework created by Chris Bissette. The player's character navigates an enigmatic, ever-changing house, attempting to understand its mystery, maintain sanity, and survive. Gameplay : The game is played with a deck of playing cards, a six-sided die, a Jenga tower, a journal, and tokens (scraps of paper) representing hope. The character's journey and experiences are documented through daily journal entries prompted by card draws. Prompt Tables : The game features four prompt tables themed after different elements: Architectural Changes, Unexplainable Phenomena, Psychological Struggles, and Discovery and Hope. Each card drawn corresponds to a specific prompt from these tables, creating unique, evolving gameplay. Endgame : The game ends when either the deck of cards is exhausted, indicating the character has survived and navigated the labyrinth for a considerable time, when the Jenga tower collapses, symbolizing a major catastrophe in the house, or when the player runs out of hope tokens, signifying complete hopelessness. Alternatively, the game can also end if the player finds an exit key and successfully escapes. Aim : The game's goal is not just survival but also crafting an engaging, immersive narrative about exploring the labyrinthine house and confronting its eerie phenomena and psychological challenges.

After a car accident that brings you to coma, you awaken in the hospital only to find out that no one is around. The hospital seems messy and looked abandoned a while ago. Some lights are off which fills most of the areas with darkness. However, you realize that you are not alone as terrifying sounds are echoing in the abyss. ___________ Echoes of the Abyss is a 2.5D horror, puzzle game. Using a top-down 3rd person perspective, the player has to navigate through the seemingly deserted hospital. Escape by scavenging for resources and unlocking doors.

One world. Four ways to see it. Echoes of the Rift is an adventure across 4 genres. Uncover secrets as you journey to close the rift. Each of the 4 game-play styles hide clues to secrets found in the others. To find all the secrets and close the rift you must repeat the loop and look for hints. Game-play Styles Each style has you navigate the same world, interact with the same characters and complete the same interconnected quest. However, unique clues and secrets are hidden across the world. Characters will have different things to say, even on new loops of the same game-play style. Top Down - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Visual Novel - Controls with mouse,  WS or arrow keys, interact with E, shift or space bar. Platformer - Controls with AS or arrow keys, jump with W or up arrow key,  interact with E, shift or space bar. First Person - Controls with WASD or arrow keys, mouse to look around, interact with E, shift, left mouse button or space bar. Echoes of the Rift was made in 4 days for the GMTK 25 Game Jam with the theme of "Loop". Why I decided to make 4 games instead of one nobody knows. Thanks for playing! You can find a video of me playing the game with commentary and revealing the locations of all the secrets here: Post-Jam Fixes Added music and sound effects Added return to menu button: Hold R for 3 seconds Fixed window scaling Fixed conditional dialogue, which was broken almost everywhere Rewrote most dialogue Made the action-y bits less fiddly Much more!

Echoes of the Past is a game made by 3  grade 7 students at Verdala International School in Malta. It was made for our IDU project in around 3-4 days. This game takes you to a future world, where you have to find remnants of Malta and watch the videos. The game has multiplayer, but it is not very good, as we were on a very tight deadline, although it should be functional. For some reason, the networking engine stopped working out of nowhere, but hopefully it works now. Screw you PUN2. Feel free to download and try our game out!

Dive into this apparently infinite dungeon, where there's no sign of external light and there are many things lurking in the shadows. Your lantern has the power of focusing light into a concentrated path, raising the temperature of everything it touches! Entry participation for Brackey's community 2023.2 Game Jam on August 2023. The theme was "Diving deeper" and even though that theme probably reminds you more of a subaquatic kind of game, I thought I could give it a spin by making it symbolize "diving"  into the darkness and "deeper" into an infinite dungeon. I had more ideas to better utilize the theme but they were scrapped due to the time limit (Game jam was 1 week). Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated!

âIf the walls could talk,â they said. But you know better. In the late hours, during the absolute darkness, the walls will open their maws and whisper their secrets, shared through cries and wails and mimicry of the horrors within. Youâre a private investigator with the unique talent of teasing out their mysteries and piecing together their meanings. This is a solo journaling RPG about the knowledge of the walls. You play it by yourself in the dark. As you draw cards, youâll be directed to prompts to write as the P.I. trying to solve a mystery. Throughout the game, youâll draw cards from your constructed Whispers Deck to learn what the walls, ceiling and floors are telling or showing you, keep notes on what you think it all means and ultimately conclude the truth.

Whispers in the Walls is a horror game with a deeper meaning. As the game progresses, the player will play through surreal experiences. More supernatural things start occurring, and the player will feel creeped out by it, while getting intrigued by what is actually going on. In actuality, this is a game made to complement a campaign that raises awareness about Alzheimer's disease. This was a cause close to our hearts, as some of us have loved ones affected by it. I was in charge of developing an incredible concept that captures the daily struggles of those living with the illness, conveying their feelings of confusion, loneliness, and frustration. We wanted the game to feel creepy, but not quite horror yet. I have written the main story, a lot of the dialogue, and I have also been the voice actor for every major role. This project was a deeply meaningful experience, allowing us to merge creativity with purpose and use game design as a tool for awareness and empathy. This game was created in three weeks.

This is the download page for it! It is not much but I think you might enjoy it for a short gaming experience. Average playtime : 10-15 minutes This game itself was more of a challenge to see what I could do in a short period of time. I hope you guys enjoy the little game that this is! This game is not finished. This game was made in three days! It could have bugs, issues, and the game length is around 10-15 minutes. Please have fun with it!

IMPORTANT! For the version downloaded from Itch.io, it is strongly recommended to add the game folder to the exceptions list of Windows Defender and other antivirus software. The game is available on Steam and GOG too. *** â'Whispers in the Moss' is a stunning tribute to the retros, a modern testament to the timeless allure of vintage gaming, and above all, a clear demonstration that the essence of passion-driven indie gaming is still very much alive and well.â RPG Gamers âWhispers in the Moss is a genuine joy to play for a retro enthusiast with a penchant for old-school RPGs. It is both steeping in gaming history and modern enough to be enjoyable without taking a 12-week correspondence course first.â 8.0 â Gaming Respawn âThen, like in The Matrix, shapes become familiar in the code: crackling fireplaces, wooden bridges across thin streams, crops in sprawling fields, and thick mountain ranges. ... Whispers in the Moss is one of the most unique games Iâve had the pleasure to try in the last twenty years.â 8/9 â Ladies Gamers *** WHISPERS IN THE MOSS is a full-scale retro JRPG experience that embraces the nostalgic charm of 8-bit and 16-bit console classics, especially those from the early SquareSoft era. Embark on an epic journey with three young heroes from a tranquil fishing village, thrust into a world dominated by an empire seeking ultimate power and a banished prince determined to restore balance. As they traverse the world, our party uncovers an even more sinister secret—fiends of the underworld are stirring... An Epic Story: Prepare for emotional plot twists, lighthearted humor, and vibrant characters. Classic Turn-Based Battles: Inspired by the early Final Fantasy games, strategically exploit your enemies' weaknesses using physical attacks, black and white magic, items, and special skills. Witness your characters' growth and customize their abilities. A Highly Unique Visual Style: The game boasts beautiful and ambitious textmode (ANSI-style) graphics, offering an unparalleled retro atmosphere. This innovative use of text-based graphics on such a scale and level of ambition is a first in gaming. Whatâs more, "Whispers in the Moss" is coded entirely in QB64, a modern take on the legendary QuickBASIC programming language, completing the genuine retro experience. Original Custom Soundtrack: Immerse yourself in the game's world with sound effects and a full original soundtrack featuring over 50 unique tracks, composed by the game's developer, Tapio of Uncultured Games. Drawing inspiration from JRPG music legends like Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Michiru Oshima, the music brings the world of the game to life. Abundance of Optional Content: In addition to the main story, explore a vast array of side quests, monster hunts, fishing and other mini-games, and other hidden secrets. Can you locate and conquer all the ~170 unique monsters and complete the bestiary? Retro Gaming for Modern Systems: "Whispers in the Moss" was released on May 31, 2024, and it is available on Itch.io, Steam, and GOG. A Decade in the Making: This artisanal game is the sole creation of Tapio from Uncultured Games, a Finnish game development studio. Single-handedly, he has managed the coding, game engine, art, script, soundtrack, and even crafted these god-forsaken marketing texts. Over the course of well over 13 years of development, Tapio, a father of two and a marketing professional by day, has remained a dedicated hobbyist game developer by night. Update Patch Notes (Latest update 1.15 was released on July 24, 2024) 1.1 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Quick Save: Added a 'Quick Save' feature when stepping on a Save Crystal. Will save on slot #1. Quit to Desktop: Added a 'Quit to Desktop' option in the game menu. Bestiary Access: You can now view the bestiary in-game by pressing ENTER when the 'Hunts' tab is open in the menu. Venom Balance: Made Rosemary items much cheaper to balance the venom status effect. Venom Bug Fix: Character's HP amount in the menu will now update as a character takes field venom damage (the bug prevented the menu from updating, and you couldn't see the damage taken). Item Shop: When browsing for items in an item shop, you can now see the equipped status of jewel-type items. Improved Interactions: Increased the interaction/activation area for various places and objects. Fishing Minigame: Some balance and bug fixes applied to the fishing minigame. Capture Skill: Adjusted the success rate for Veda's 'Capture' skill. Steal Skill: Adjusted the success rate for Orion's 'Steal' skill. Bug Fixes: Numerous other small bug fixes implemented. Dialogue Fixes: Numerous small dialogue adjustments made. Balance Tweaks: Numerous small balance adjustments made. 1.15 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Increased success rate for Veda's Capture skill. Increased success rate for Orion's Steal skill. Slightly increased gold accumulation from battles, stealing, and chests. Increased likelihood of encountering rare fish in the fishing mini-game. Adjusted stats and attacks of certain enemies. Fixed bestiary index number bug (index number shown at the end of battle now matches the number in the bestiary). Various text and script fixes. Fixed warp bugs on a few maps. Fixed a critical endgame bug that occasionally caused the game to identify regular battles as specific boss battles. Added support for the A/D keys during battles, allowing players to browse skills in both directions (can be used instead of TAB). Numerous smaller fixes.

Whispers In The Darkness is a collection of four dark MÃRK BORG adventures that will take you through a weird lovecraftian trip. Starting from a Galgenbeck cathedral haunted by a possessed abbess, plunging in cold ocean depths to discover the forgotten SÃ¼dglans, then up the peaks of Bergen Chrypt to commune with the God-Eating Darkness, and finally reaching the metaphysical island of Venus Red after consuming the bleeding Mothershrooms. These four adventures were originally written for my Patreon . Whispers In The Darkness was first compiled for the Wicked Wanderers Winter Bundle by The Lost Bay Studios . Whispers In The Darkness is an independent production by Nyhur and is not affiliated with Ockult ÃrtmÃ¤stare Games or Stockholm Kartell. It is published under the MÃRK BORG Third Party License. MÃRK BORG is copyright Ockult ÃrtmÃ¤stare Games and Stockholm Kartell.

Welcome to the forest! These woods have been your home for many, many years… but something dark has begun worming its way in. Very little of the warm place you once knew now stands, as animals have been infected by the shadow. The lush green spring in Barons Burrow offers hope, but its light is dimming. So follow me, traveler, on your final adventure - for the safety of hearth and home! Credits: Art by Sarah f-v (@bugcub on instagram) Game by Lizzie of Fables and Fae (@ofFablesAndFae on instagram)

In the heart of an ancient, abandoned mansion, your character awakens to the chilling realization that they are trapped in a dark room. The air is heavy with the stench of decay, and an unsettling silence hangs in the darkness. A single lantern in their hand casting eerie shadows that dance along the cold walls. They realize they were locked in by a mysterious monster. Armed only with the flickering lantern, they have to discover five cryptic papers with numbers of a code and clues leading to the next location of the next paper. As your character unravels the mysteries of the mansion, piecing together the digits, they approach the exit. The shadows come alive, but the monster seems to be an observer rather than an obstacle. Armed only with the lantern, your character faces the final challenge against the vengeful spirits guarding their escape- the secret code. In this last struggle, they must navigate the haunted room's depths, avoiding entities drawn to the lantern's feeble light. Succeeding means breaking free from the room's clutches, with the monster watching from the shadows. Failure would mean becoming another whisper in the haunted halls. The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival and spectral intrigue. Will your character escape the haunted mansion, or become another lost soul swallowed by the shadows? The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival.

Whispers in the Shadows is a game made for the UDC Jam #28 In the game, you are an explorer desperately trying to save the forest from the shadows that currently haunt it. The only way to do so is to find all 3 of the gems hidden in the forest and restore their place in the Shrine. The task you are about to undergo isn't going to be an easy one, as the Shadows that currently live in the forest will try to stop you. Although they may be blind, they can still hear you, so be as silent as you can while traversing through the woods.

You accidentally fell into another dimension, witnessing something that once happened, or is still happening, in that space. What happened to the new transfer student? Why are the students in the class disappearing one by one? Could the teacher's indifference also be a form of guilt? A story about school violence. While I think explaining a story can sometimes feel unnecessary, Iâll give it a try... In this game, the player takes on the role of a teacher who enters a school and begins to experience the life of a new transfer student. The teacher/player witnesses the whispers,   mocking and bullying directed at the student. As the teacher enters the classroom, he begins to relive his own actions towards his students. He remembers how he would casually inquire about their well-being but never truly cared to understand what was really happening to the transfer student—or to any of his students. Throughout the game, the player's identity shifts several times. They embody the transfer student, the teacher, and another bullied student who interacts with the transfer student(in the locker). In the later act, the transfer student realize just hiding would not stop other students from bullying, he begins to seek revenge, and the teacher/player is left as the last one standing. The ending leaves it to the player's imagination to consider what fate might await him. I realize this might be a bit hard to follow, but I'll try something less complex next time... maybe. shorts: playthrough: ( hiding place is at 01:30)

âIf the walls could talk,â they said. But you know better. In the late hours, during the absolute darkness, the walls will open their maws and whisper their secrets, shared through cries and wails and mimicry of the horrors within. Youâre a private investigator with the unique talent of teasing out their mysteries and piecing together their meanings. This is a solo journaling RPG about the knowledge of the walls. You play it by yourself in the dark. As you draw cards, youâll be directed to prompts to write as the P.I. trying to solve a mystery. Throughout the game, youâll draw cards from your constructed Whispers Deck to learn what the walls, ceiling and floors are telling or showing you, keep notes on what you think it all means and ultimately conclude the truth. A session takes between 15 and 60 minutes and is highly replayable. Each session is unique.

Whispers in the Walls is a horror game with a deeper meaning. As the game progresses, the player will play through surreal experiences. More supernatural things start occurring, and the player will feel creeped out by it, while getting intrigued by what is actually going on. In actuality, this is a game made to complement a campaign that raises awareness about Alzheimer's disease. This was a cause close to our hearts, as some of us have loved ones affected by it. I was in charge of developing an incredible concept that captures the daily struggles of those living with the illness, conveying their feelings of confusion, loneliness, and frustration. We wanted the game to feel creepy, but not quite horror yet. I have written the main story, a lot of the dialogue, and I have also been the voice actor for every major role. This project was a deeply meaningful experience, allowing us to merge creativity with purpose and use game design as a tool for awareness and empathy. This game was created in three weeks.

IMPORTANT! For the version downloaded from Itch.io, it is strongly recommended to add the game folder to the exceptions list of Windows Defender and other antivirus software. The game is available on Steam and GOG too. *** â'Whispers in the Moss' is a stunning tribute to the retros, a modern testament to the timeless allure of vintage gaming, and above all, a clear demonstration that the essence of passion-driven indie gaming is still very much alive and well.â RPG Gamers âWhispers in the Moss is a genuine joy to play for a retro enthusiast with a penchant for old-school RPGs. It is both steeping in gaming history and modern enough to be enjoyable without taking a 12-week correspondence course first.â 8.0 â Gaming Respawn âThen, like in The Matrix, shapes become familiar in the code: crackling fireplaces, wooden bridges across thin streams, crops in sprawling fields, and thick mountain ranges. ... Whispers in the Moss is one of the most unique games Iâve had the pleasure to try in the last twenty years.â 8/9 â Ladies Gamers *** WHISPERS IN THE MOSS is a full-scale retro JRPG experience that embraces the nostalgic charm of 8-bit and 16-bit console classics, especially those from the early SquareSoft era. Embark on an epic journey with three young heroes from a tranquil fishing village, thrust into a world dominated by an empire seeking ultimate power and a banished prince determined to restore balance. As they traverse the world, our party uncovers an even more sinister secret—fiends of the underworld are stirring... An Epic Story: Prepare for emotional plot twists, lighthearted humor, and vibrant characters. Classic Turn-Based Battles: Inspired by the early Final Fantasy games, strategically exploit your enemies' weaknesses using physical attacks, black and white magic, items, and special skills. Witness your characters' growth and customize their abilities. A Highly Unique Visual Style: The game boasts beautiful and ambitious textmode (ANSI-style) graphics, offering an unparalleled retro atmosphere. This innovative use of text-based graphics on such a scale and level of ambition is a first in gaming. Whatâs more, "Whispers in the Moss" is coded entirely in QB64, a modern take on the legendary QuickBASIC programming language, completing the genuine retro experience. Original Custom Soundtrack: Immerse yourself in the game's world with sound effects and a full original soundtrack featuring over 50 unique tracks, composed by the game's developer, Tapio of Uncultured Games. Drawing inspiration from JRPG music legends like Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Michiru Oshima, the music brings the world of the game to life. Abundance of Optional Content: In addition to the main story, explore a vast array of side quests, monster hunts, fishing and other mini-games, and other hidden secrets. Can you locate and conquer all the ~170 unique monsters and complete the bestiary? Retro Gaming for Modern Systems: "Whispers in the Moss" was released on May 31, 2024, and it is available on Itch.io, Steam, and GOG. A Decade in the Making: This artisanal game is the sole creation of Tapio from Uncultured Games, a Finnish game development studio. Single-handedly, he has managed the coding, game engine, art, script, soundtrack, and even crafted these god-forsaken marketing texts. Over the course of well over 13 years of development, Tapio, a father of two and a marketing professional by day, has remained a dedicated hobbyist game developer by night. Update Patch Notes (Latest update 1.15 was released on July 24, 2024) 1.1 Update (Released July 24, 2024 on Itch.io): Quick Save: Added a 'Quick Save' feature when stepping on a Save Crystal. Will save on slot #1. Quit to Desktop: Added a 'Quit to Desktop' option in the game menu. Bestiary Access: You can now view the bestiary in-game by pressing ENTER when the 'Hunts' tab is open in the menu. Venom Balance: Made Rosemary items much cheaper to balance the venom status effect. Venom Bug Fix: Character's HP amount in the menu will now update as a character takes field venom damage (the bug prevented the menu from updating, and you couldn't see the damage taken).

These four adventures were originally written for my Patreon . Whispers In The Darkness was first compiled for the Wicked Wanderers Winter Bundle by The Lost Bay Studios .

Welcome to the forest! These woods have been your home for many, many years… but something dark has begun worming its way in. Very little of the warm place you once knew now stands, as animals have been infected by the shadow. The lush green spring in Barons Burrow offers hope, but its light is dimming.

In the heart of an ancient, abandoned mansion, your character awakens to the chilling realization that they are trapped in a dark room. The air is heavy with the stench of decay, and an unsettling silence hangs in the darkness. A single lantern in their hand casting eerie shadows that dance along the cold walls. They realize they were locked in by a mysterious monster. Armed only with the flickering lantern, they have to discover five cryptic papers with numbers of a code and clues leading to the next location of the next paper. As your character unravels the mysteries of the mansion, piecing together the digits, they approach the exit. The shadows come alive, but the monster seems to be an observer rather than an obstacle. Armed only with the lantern, your character faces the final challenge against the vengeful spirits guarding their escape- the secret code. In this last struggle, they must navigate the haunted room's depths, avoiding entities drawn to the lantern's feeble light. Succeeding means breaking free from the room's clutches, with the monster watching from the shadows. Failure would mean becoming another whisper in the haunted halls. The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival and spectral intrigue. Will your character escape the haunted mansion, or become another lost soul swallowed by the shadows? The choice is yours in this harrowing tale of survival.

Although they may be blind, they can still hear you, so be as silent as you can while traversing through the woods.

Enter the haunting realm of 'Whispers in the Halls,' a spine-chilling ambient horror game crafted for our university hackathon. Maneuver through the shadowy corridors of the Computer Science building using a unique control scheme: Q to look left, W to move forward, and E to look right, all while employing the mouse to interact with the environment. However, escaping the halls isn't just about navigation. Players must solve a puzzle to unlock the path to freedom. But here's the catch: you only get one chance to solve it. The tension mounts as whispers echo around you, hinting at unseen dangers lurking in the darkness. Can you decipher the puzzle and escape, or will the relentless whispers claim you forever?

A Warhammer 40,000 fan game In the cold void of the Warp, aboard the Luna-class cruiser 'Repentance', a lone guardsman's faith is tested. As Clydas stands vigil in the ship's vital control room, an insidious voice awakens within him. Is it truly his inner self, or something far more sinister? With Chaos threatening his homeworld and loved ones in peril, Clydas faces a terrible choice. Will he remain true to the Emperor's light, or give in to temptation and doom all he holds dear? Warning: This game contains themes of temptation and corruption suitable for mature audiences. Note: This game was created for the O2A2 2024 - Visual Novel Jam, adhering to strict limitations on art assets and word count. The focused scope is intentional, delivering a concentrated dose of grimdark storytelling.

Can you find your way out? After a long nights out, our young couple, James and Penny, wind up in a secluded hotel. What follows next can only be described, as a nightmare. Game includes: Good story - This story, although short, will you leave you wondering, confused and scared. Clean visuals - Although not on par with the big dogs, these scenes have been carefully built, leading to a pleasant experience. Beautiful sounds - These sounds have been carefully put together, ranging from epic fight music to the simple hum of a car! Multiple Choices - The replayability is great, as this game has multiple choices, taking you down a different route each time. Please let me know what you think and be kind as this is my second game, Thanks!

You accidentally fell into another dimension, witnessing something that once happened, or is still happening, in that space. What happened to the new transfer student? Why are the students in the class disappearing one by one? Could the teacher's indifference also be a form of guilt? A story about school violence. While I think explaining a story can sometimes feel unnecessary, Iâll give it a try... In this game, the player takes on the role of a teacher who enters a school and begins to experience the life of a new transfer student. The teacher/player witnesses the whispers,   mocking and bullying directed at the student. As the teacher enters the classroom, he begins to relive his own actions towards his students. He remembers how he would casually inquire about their well-being but never truly cared to understand what was really happening to the transfer student—or to any of his students. Throughout the game, the player's identity shifts several times. They embody the transfer student, the teacher, and another bullied student who interacts with the transfer student(in the locker). In the later act, the transfer student realize just hiding would not stop other students from bullying, he begins to seek revenge, and the teacher/player is left as the last one standing. The ending leaves it to the player's imagination to consider what fate might await him. I realize this might be a bit hard to follow, but I'll try something less complex next time... maybe. shorts: playthrough: ( hiding place is at 01:30)

<AUTHOR>Ghostbrite</AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
Horror Vacui was created as a solo project/first ever game by Skelefactor founder Tony Ransom. It was designed to be a game that is simple to pick up, but also to continually surprise the players. The basic premise is that you must clear a series of rooms by controlling each floor tile in each room. Various enemies wander about, stealing your control from each tile that they walk on. You can destroy the enemies, but only by powering up through the claiming of tiles. A strange sort of resource management and suspense arises from the dynamic of tile claiming and enemy take-downs. Five unique worlds with strange mechanics to master. A host of eldritch enemies to keep you guessing. Novel boss battles that introduce additional game-play twists. An incomprehensible codex that reveals more "information" as you progress. Additional modes of play, including a Hardcore mode, if you can manage to unlock them. Secret power-ups that fundamentally change how you can approach each game. We've been told it's pretty hard, so heads up on that. Though Horror Vacui's development may be completed, we at Skelefactor are committed to the life-long support of all of our games. From time to time we'll get ideas on how to enhance a particular aspect, or a player will alert us to an obscure bug. As long as we're alive, we're going to keep making these things better. skelefactor.com

<TEXT>
Ravenwood Horror is a horror themed puzzle game. I made it a while back in 2008 (under the nickname Min Chan). But when I discovered this awesome site I decide to share it here as well for (hopefully) your enjoyment! It's made in RPG Maker VX. You assume the role of psychiatrist Henry Smith, who is trapped at the mansion of his recently gone crazy patient H. Wilkins. You need to explore and solve puzzles in order to escape and find out what is the cause of all this mess. Multiple endings depending on your actions (full exploration is rewarded!) and about 2 hours of gameplay for your first time. There is a hint walkthrough in the game files, and also a few let's plays videos on YouTube. This game is fanmade using resources not made by me and as such is a free game. However if you want to donate and help the bill paying while I'm working on my current project, you are more than welcome to do so! Thank you for taking the time to check the game out, I hope you enjoy!

<TITLE>Horror Prelude Music Pack</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>ceremonial</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://ceremonial.itch.io/horror-prelude</URL>
<TEXT>
Designed for RPG Maker, this 10-track pack aims to supplement your horror-mystery game with instrumental compositions. Preview https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/416230211&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true Terms A copy of the terms of usage is included in the download files. Please read it before using it, but in short, credit me (CeremonialDoll3702) in all occasions, and also remember to send me a free copy of the game if used in commercial games (edit: please just forget about sending me a copy from now on... that was such a stupid rule. I now waive the requirement to send me a free copy.). What is Included 10 tracks, with some extra "soundscape" tracks. Some extra SE (RPG Maker sound effects), and some ME (music effects) are also included. Usage If you simply want to use this in your game, download the first file (with ogg, mp3), and simply copy all the ogg files (or mp3 files, just that I personally recommend ogg over mp3) into their respective folders. If you want to also want to remix, or to do some editing on the tracks themselves for your personal usage, you should download the uncompressed flac files first. Donating If you donate at least $3 to me through itch.io on this product (which means I get $2.7 with the default share, so if you want to do it any other way that results in me getting $2.7 through itch.io, I am fine with it), the crediting rule and the give me a free copy of your commercial game rule is waived. See the LICENSE.txt file for more details. And just in case it gets confusing: donating is optional for using the music, please read the LICENSE.txt in the downloaded files.

<TITLE>Horror AI Toolkit</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Hickery</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://hickery.itch.io/unity-horror-ai-toolkit</URL>
<TEXT>
This toolkit provides a customisable AI system for you to include in your own Unity projects, focusing primarily on the creation of enemies for horror games. Inspired by games such as Left 4 Dead and Alien: Isolation , a director AI governs the aggression of enemies, groups them together and can dynamically spawn and remove them to alter the pacing during game play. The toolkit is flexible and can support a number of AIs at a given time, ranging from a single enemy to larger groups. Included in the download is a short game demo, along with showcases of the AI, as well as the toolkit itself. The primary features of this toolkit include: A director AI which controls the pacing of the game, as well as the aggression of AI enemies, through a Stress Meter.  The director can also group AIs together, and can dynamically spawn and remove enemies based on the current Stress Level. Three prebuilt AI types. Advanced AI, which offer more detailed features and work individually. Basic AI, which are more simplistic but can be organised into groups. Scout AI, which will signal nearby allies to come to their aid. Advanced sound and sight search. AI agents will learn different types of sounds, and will begin to ignore any which they have heard too often. Node based navigation and learning. Nodes can be placed within a level to mark rooms or points of interest, and can be given a room type. The AI will used these nodes to learn the player's behaviour. The more often they spot the player near a node type, the more likely they will search that type in the future. All features can be customised to your liking and even toggled off. Other features include: Hide in objects. Place lockers which the player can hide in to avoid detection from enemies. Certain enemy types can search these and pull the player out. Doors. The player can open and close doors, and can also peek around them in order to see whats on the other side. AI will also navigate through and open doors. A flashlight power and flickering system. The player can collect batteries in order to power their flashlight, which will dim and flicker when low on energy. Current issues and future development: A player sanity system, making use of the AI director to make small changes to levels and place objects, as well as spawning audio and scare cues. Currently the player's actions are dependant on Unity's first person controller standard asset, which I have made some changes to. If you are also using this controller in your own project, please be aware of potential conflicts which may occur. I plan on removing these dependencies in the future.

<TEXT>
This pack includes 10 professionally-made ambient soundtracks, suitable for horror games, movies or youtube videos. Every file has at least one variation and three file formats, meaning that you're actually buying over 50 individual tracks! Some of these are made specially for this pack, and others are tracks I made for abandoned projects of mine. All tracks include wav, mp3 and ogg versions ready to be dropped into any project! All of the included tracks can be used in any commercial project. It would be appreciated if you credit me in your project! Play the video to hear some snippets of the included tracks! Tracklist with descriptions for each track below: Night of the Infection - A short but extremely unnerving soundscape, perfect for a zombie uprising. Darkest Souls - A short,  intense loop with heavy drums and a choir in the background. Perfect for a big boss battle! Blood Moon - The demons have risen and you must sneak out of the city! This track teases the fact that something may be near, but you can never be sure... Faraway Night - You can hear a distant piano playing. Who is playing it, I wonder? This sad piece transforms into a more hopeful song, and is designed to be a loop for a title screen or credits sequence. Also comes with a version containing less reverb resulting in a clearer piano sound. They're Coming - A progressive  soundscape with a hellish end, including many distant demons. They're coming... we must go. Chains - A very unnerving, metallic soundscape, using a sample from one of the tracks from my horror game - Tenome! Intergalactic Horror - A sci-fi horror ambience. Dark synths tease that something is coming. Possession - A ghost has entered your home and is attempting to control you. Try to survive the ghastly moans and droans in this track. Her Music Box - After she died, we never touched her favourite music box, yet it never stops playing its demonic tune. Exploring the Night - A dark and mysterious soundscape, fitting for an exploration game or ghost-hunting series. (BONUS) Escape From Hell - An intense music track, accompanying one's escape from the demons of hell using synths and guitars. This was used for a now-abandoned project of mine, in a level where you were being chased by hordes of demons through a hellish landscape. Also, the second drop is my favourite. Still not convinced? Download "Night of the Infection" for free below!

<AUTHOR>Olivia</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://fallenangelolivia.itch.io/horror-effects-plugin</URL>
<TEXT>
This is a RPG Maker MV plugin that will allow you to add visual horror effects to your game's title screen, maps, events, pictures, battle, etc. You can turn on individual effects at a time or multiple simultaneously. The effects include a noise effect, a glitch effect, and a TV effect, which is commonly seen used in most horror films. Now, you can use these effects in RPG Maker MV, too! Be warned that this plugin was made in RPG Maker MV 1.6.1 and is untested in lower versions so I cannot guarantee if it will work. To update to the latest version, please download the update here to at least 1.6.1 . Sample Project Includes The sample project download for this will include the following: The main plugin itself along with some supporting plugins . The plugin can run without these supporting plugins as they are only used for the purpose of demonstrating in the sample project. Sample plugin commands and demonstrated individually on various aspects of the game so you can double check your work with mine to make sure it works in your game. Preconfigured plugin parameters to add the Horror Effects to your title screen, too! Plugin Parameters Title1 Effects: Animate the Title1 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects?

<TEXT>
InformaÃ§Ãµes bÃ¡sicas TÃ­tulo: Lilith: um horror visual novel GÃªnero: visual novel, horror, drama ClassificaÃ§Ã£o: 16 anos PÃºblico-alvo: jovens e adultos Engine: RenâPy Engine Data de inicializaÃ§Ã£o: janeiro de 2018 SituaÃ§Ã£o: projeto em desenvolvimento Tempo de jogo: aprox. 30 minutos VersÃ£o: demo 1.3 FEEDBACK: https://forms.gle/iVncP2Xiot2Si4jw5 Por favor, deixe o seu feedback preenchendo o formulÃ¡rio acima. Proposta Este projeto Ã© o resultado de um ano do meu Trabalho de ConclusÃ£o de Curso e, apesar de ter sido pensado para ser mais extenso, foi realizado apenas o capÃ­tulo um do enredo. A proposta principal deste jogo Ã© trabalhar questÃµes sobre a bruxaria na Idade Moderna por meio de uma personagem bruxa que tivesse caracterÃ­sticas mais significativas, contornando estereÃ³tipos misÃ³ginos que foram consolidados ao longo dos sÃ©culos a respeito da bruxa histÃ³rica. Em outras palavras, desenvolver uma bruxa que tivesse mais voz e empoderamento a fim de enfrentar os preconceitos de sua Ã©poca. Enredo No auge da InquisiÃ§Ã£o, Lilith, uma jovem camponesa, passa a sonhar com a figura do bode. Preocupada com o que isso possa significar, ela tenta se redimir de seus pecados, mas acaba conhecendo no caminho uma mulher suspeita e mal falada na Vila que comeÃ§a a incitar nela o desejo de revolta contra as obrigaÃ§Ãµes impostas pela sua famÃ­lia e pela igreja local. Lilith descobrirÃ¡, entÃ£o, que existe outra opÃ§Ã£o para sua vida pacata, um caminho sem volta em direÃ§Ã£o Ã  bruxaria.

This game was made in 7 days for the Scream Season game jam. Your goal is to collect the presents from the front of the train and bring them to the back without getting caught by the horror patrolling the train cars. NOTE: Due to browser updates, the Armory Engine can no longer lock your mouse in windowed mode or on anything besides Chrome. Firefox will not lock your mouse and you will be unable to turn unless you use the arrow keys which are assigned to tank controls. Internet Explorer/Edge is not supported by the Armory engine because that browser is trash. If you're going to play in browser, you must play it on Chrome in fullscreen for mouse input, use the tank controls/arrow keys, otherwise download the game. If you're experiencing performance or loading issues, we also recommend the downloadable version. We hope you enjoy this short game!

<TEXT>
We are a small indie studio, which just released their first VR project Horror Nights Story to the Oculus store! The game has a long past all the way to the year 2015 but this is the first time we are releasing it as a VR version. You can find links to Oculus store here. Rift: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/2211532715627723 Go: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/2213141572055850 Quest: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3690488997696298/ Now... We see as the whole internet is calling for fnaf release to Oculus Quest and we would like to give you guys something like it.  We want to give you access to our game for free through technique of Sideload, if you are familiar with this. If not just google it its pretty easy . You can download and install this games build on your Quest for free this way! You might be asking why don't we just release this on Oculus Quest store but the truth is it is much harder then other stores, since the level of game has to be really high for the game to get it published into the App store. And quite frankly we didn't even tried to publish it because we know our game is not there yet, but we will keep working hard on the game so we can reach the level so we can get it published! We won't be updating the version of the build that is available for download, but in the future we will definitely support cross-buy if we will qet to Quest App store. In future updates: Flashlight feature, Replay ability, Better interaction with monsters etc.. If you would guys like to support us. Go and buy our game in Oculus Rift, Go App store or here SteamVR will follow.. Join our Discord https://discord.com/widget?id=584852114057199621&theme=dark And you can also follow us on twitter or instagram https://twitter.com/paperbunker https://instagram.com/paperbunkergames Thank you for your support! ------ Dig and find freedom through old mine, while running away from bloodthirsty horde of monsters, which is chasing you. But be on lookout! You will have to take care of all 5 bombs prepared for destroying the mine. http://paperbunker.cz ------ 5.8.2019 Version 0.2: Because, Oculus made some changes in latest firmware.. Our version for the Quest wasn't playable. So, we fixed it.. Plus added fancy vibration when you have some jump scares :)

<TITLE>Horror Vacui</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Ghostbrite</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://ghostbrite.itch.io/horror-vacui</URL>
<TEXT>
Horror Vacui was created as a solo project/first ever game by Skelefactor founder Tony Ransom. It was designed to be a game that is simple to pick up, but also to continually surprise the players. The basic premise is that you must clear a series of rooms by controlling each floor tile in each room. Various enemies wander about, stealing your control from each tile that they walk on. You can destroy the enemies, but only by powering up through the claiming of tiles. A strange sort of resource management and suspense arises from the dynamic of tile claiming and enemy take-downs. Five unique worlds with strange mechanics to master. A host of eldritch enemies to keep you guessing. Novel boss battles that introduce additional game-play twists. An incomprehensible codex that reveals more "information" as you progress. Additional modes of play, including a Hardcore mode, if you can manage to unlock them. Secret power-ups that fundamentally change how you can approach each game. We've been told it's pretty hard, so heads up on that. Though Horror Vacui's development may be completed, we at Skelefactor are committed to the life-long support of all of our games. From time to time we'll get ideas on how to enhance a particular aspect, or a player will alert us to an obscure bug. As long as we're alive, we're going to keep making these things better. skelefactor.com

18 different horror themed sprites. Each of them is drawn by hand and is exported on one spritesheet with transparent background. I've used the Endesga 32 Palette to create these. The wall in the background is part of my free dungeon tileset. Feel free to use it however you want (CC0). Attribution is appreciated but not required!

This is archive content! As such, I will likely not be providing updates on it or answering technical issues regarding game engines I have no knowledge of. I've been continually asked to release battle sprites for the Horror City packs and, despite not particularly being happy with these results, I've decided to release them. If you wish to use these, you may do so for free, though donations are always welcome. Again, these are unfinished, archived resources, not optimised for any engine. Do not redistribute. Please give credit if used, and I hope you find some enjoyment in them!

<TEXT>
Ravenwood Horror is a horror themed puzzle game. I made it a while back in 2008 (under the nickname Min Chan). But when I discovered this awesome site I decide to share it here as well for (hopefully) your enjoyment! It's made in RPG Maker VX. You assume the role of psychiatrist Henry Smith, who is trapped at the mansion of his recently gone crazy patient H. Wilkins. You need to explore and solve puzzles in order to escape and find out what is the cause of all this mess. Multiple endings depending on your actions (full exploration is rewarded!) and about 2 hours of gameplay for your first time. There is a hint walkthrough in the game files, and also a few let's plays videos on YouTube. This game is fanmade using resources not made by me and as such is a free game. However if you want to donate and help the bill paying while I'm working on my current project, you are more than welcome to do so! Thank you for taking the time to check the game out, I hope you enjoy!

<TITLE>Horror Prelude Music Pack</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>ceremonial</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://ceremonial.itch.io/horror-prelude</URL>
<TEXT>
Designed for RPG Maker, this 10-track pack aims to supplement your horror-mystery game with instrumental compositions. Preview https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/416230211&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true Terms A copy of the terms of usage is included in the download files. Please read it before using it, but in short, credit me (CeremonialDoll3702) in all occasions, and also remember to send me a free copy of the game if used in commercial games (edit: please just forget about sending me a copy from now on... that was such a stupid rule. I now waive the requirement to send me a free copy.). What is Included 10 tracks, with some extra "soundscape" tracks. Some extra SE (RPG Maker sound effects), and some ME (music effects) are also included. Usage If you simply want to use this in your game, download the first file (with ogg, mp3), and simply copy all the ogg files (or mp3 files, just that I personally recommend ogg over mp3) into their respective folders. If you want to also want to remix, or to do some editing on the tracks themselves for your personal usage, you should download the uncompressed flac files first. Donating If you donate at least $3 to me through itch.io on this product (which means I get $2.7 with the default share, so if you want to do it any other way that results in me getting $2.7 through itch.io, I am fine with it), the crediting rule and the give me a free copy of your commercial game rule is waived. See the LICENSE.txt file for more details. And just in case it gets confusing: donating is optional for using the music, please read the LICENSE.txt in the downloaded files.

<TITLE>Horror AI Toolkit</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Hickery</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://hickery.itch.io/unity-horror-ai-toolkit</URL>
<TEXT>
This toolkit provides a customisable AI system for you to include in your own Unity projects, focusing primarily on the creation of enemies for horror games. Inspired by games such as Left 4 Dead and Alien: Isolation , a director AI governs the aggression of enemies, groups them together and can dynamically spawn and remove them to alter the pacing during game play. The toolkit is flexible and can support a number of AIs at a given time, ranging from a single enemy to larger groups. Included in the download is a short game demo, along with showcases of the AI, as well as the toolkit itself. The primary features of this toolkit include: A director AI which controls the pacing of the game, as well as the aggression of AI enemies, through a Stress Meter.  The director can also group AIs together, and can dynamically spawn and remove enemies based on the current Stress Level. Three prebuilt AI types. Advanced AI, which offer more detailed features and work individually. Basic AI, which are more simplistic but can be organised into groups. Scout AI, which will signal nearby allies to come to their aid. Advanced sound and sight search. AI agents will learn different types of sounds, and will begin to ignore any which they have heard too often. Node based navigation and learning. Nodes can be placed within a level to mark rooms or points of interest, and can be given a room type. The AI will used these nodes to learn the player's behaviour. The more often they spot the player near a node type, the more likely they will search that type in the future. All features can be customised to your liking and even toggled off. Other features include: Hide in objects. Place lockers which the player can hide in to avoid detection from enemies. Certain enemy types can search these and pull the player out. Doors. The player can open and close doors, and can also peek around them in order to see whats on the other side. AI will also navigate through and open doors. A flashlight power and flickering system. The player can collect batteries in order to power their flashlight, which will dim and flicker when low on energy. Current issues and future development: A player sanity system, making use of the AI director to make small changes to levels and place objects, as well as spawning audio and scare cues. Currently the player's actions are dependant on Unity's first person controller standard asset, which I have made some changes to. If you are also using this controller in your own project, please be aware of potential conflicts which may occur. I plan on removing these dependencies in the future.

<TEXT>
This pack includes 10 professionally-made ambient soundtracks, suitable for horror games, movies or youtube videos. Every file has at least one variation and three file formats, meaning that you're actually buying over 50 individual tracks! Some of these are made specially for this pack, and others are tracks I made for abandoned projects of mine. All tracks include wav, mp3 and ogg versions ready to be dropped into any project! All of the included tracks can be used in any commercial project. It would be appreciated if you credit me in your project! Play the video to hear some snippets of the included tracks! Tracklist with descriptions for each track below: Night of the Infection - A short but extremely unnerving soundscape, perfect for a zombie uprising. Darkest Souls - A short,  intense loop with heavy drums and a choir in the background. Perfect for a big boss battle! Blood Moon - The demons have risen and you must sneak out of the city! This track teases the fact that something may be near, but you can never be sure... Faraway Night - You can hear a distant piano playing. Who is playing it, I wonder? This sad piece transforms into a more hopeful song, and is designed to be a loop for a title screen or credits sequence. Also comes with a version containing less reverb resulting in a clearer piano sound. They're Coming - A progressive  soundscape with a hellish end, including many distant demons. They're coming... we must go. Chains - A very unnerving, metallic soundscape, using a sample from one of the tracks from my horror game - Tenome! Intergalactic Horror - A sci-fi horror ambience. Dark synths tease that something is coming. Possession - A ghost has entered your home and is attempting to control you. Try to survive the ghastly moans and droans in this track. Her Music Box - After she died, we never touched her favourite music box, yet it never stops playing its demonic tune. Exploring the Night - A dark and mysterious soundscape, fitting for an exploration game or ghost-hunting series. (BONUS) Escape From Hell - An intense music track, accompanying one's escape from the demons of hell using synths and guitars. This was used for a now-abandoned project of mine, in a level where you were being chased by hordes of demons through a hellish landscape. Also, the second drop is my favourite. Still not convinced? Download "Night of the Infection" for free below!

<TITLE>Horror Effects plugin for RPG Maker MV$8.99-10%</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>Olivia</AUTHOR>
<URL>https://fallenangelolivia.itch.io/horror-effects-plugin</URL>
<TEXT>
This is a RPG Maker MV plugin that will allow you to add visual horror effects to your game's title screen, maps, events, pictures, battle, etc. You can turn on individual effects at a time or multiple simultaneously. The effects include a noise effect, a glitch effect, and a TV effect, which is commonly seen used in most horror films. Now, you can use these effects in RPG Maker MV, too! Be warned that this plugin was made in RPG Maker MV 1.6.1 and is untested in lower versions so I cannot guarantee if it will work. To update to the latest version, please download the update here to at least 1.6.1 . Sample Project Includes The sample project download for this will include the following: The main plugin itself along with some supporting plugins . The plugin can run without these supporting plugins as they are only used for the purpose of demonstrating in the sample project. Sample plugin commands and demonstrated individually on various aspects of the game so you can double check your work with mine to make sure it works in your game. Preconfigured plugin parameters to add the Horror Effects to your title screen, too! Plugin Parameters Title1 Effects: Animate the Title1 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects? This will be the first image used in the Database, System, Title Screen setting for your game. Title2 Effects: Animate the Title2 image with noise, glitch, or TV effects?

InformaÃ§Ãµes bÃ¡sicas TÃ­tulo: Lilith: um horror visual novel GÃªnero: visual novel, horror, drama ClassificaÃ§Ã£o: 16 anos PÃºblico-alvo: jovens e adultos Engine: RenâPy Engine Data de inicializaÃ§Ã£o: janeiro de 2018 SituaÃ§Ã£o: projeto em desenvolvimento Tempo de jogo: aprox. 30 minutos VersÃ£o: demo 1.3 FEEDBACK: https://forms.gle/iVncP2Xiot2Si4jw5 Por favor, deixe o seu feedback preenchendo o formulÃ¡rio acima. Proposta Este projeto Ã© o resultado de um ano do meu Trabalho de ConclusÃ£o de Curso e, apesar de ter sido pensado para ser mais extenso, foi realizado apenas o capÃ­tulo um do enredo. A proposta principal deste jogo Ã© trabalhar questÃµes sobre a bruxaria na Idade Moderna por meio de uma personagem bruxa que tivesse caracterÃ­sticas mais significativas, contornando estereÃ³tipos misÃ³ginos que foram consolidados ao longo dos sÃ©culos a respeito da bruxa histÃ³rica. Em outras palavras, desenvolver uma bruxa que tivesse mais voz e empoderamento a fim de enfrentar os preconceitos de sua Ã©poca. Enredo No auge da InquisiÃ§Ã£o, Lilith, uma jovem camponesa, passa a sonhar com a figura do bode. Preocupada com o que isso possa significar, ela tenta se redimir de seus pecados, mas acaba conhecendo no caminho uma mulher suspeita e mal falada na Vila que comeÃ§a a incitar nela o desejo de revolta contra as obrigaÃ§Ãµes impostas pela sua famÃ­lia e pela igreja local. Lilith descobrirÃ¡, entÃ£o, que existe outra opÃ§Ã£o para sua vida pacata, um caminho sem volta em direÃ§Ã£o Ã  bruxaria.

This game was made in 7 days for the Scream Season game jam. Your goal is to collect the presents from the front of the train and bring them to the back without getting caught by the horror patrolling the train cars. NOTE: Due to browser updates, the Armory Engine can no longer lock your mouse in windowed mode or on anything besides Chrome. Firefox will not lock your mouse and you will be unable to turn unless you use the arrow keys which are assigned to tank controls. Internet Explorer/Edge is not supported by the Armory engine because that browser is trash. If you're going to play in browser, you must play it on Chrome in fullscreen for mouse input, use the tank controls/arrow keys, otherwise download the game. If you're experiencing performance or loading issues, we also recommend the downloadable version. We hope you enjoy this short game!

We are a small indie studio, which just released their first VR project Horror Nights Story to the Oculus store! The game has a long past all the way to the year 2015 but this is the first time we are releasing it as a VR version. You can find links to Oculus store here. Rift: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/2211532715627723 Go: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/2213141572055850 Quest: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3690488997696298/ Now... We see as the whole internet is calling for fnaf release to Oculus Quest and we would like to give you guys something like it.  We want to give you access to our game for free through technique of Sideload, if you are familiar with this. If not just google it its pretty easy . You can download and install this games build on your Quest for free this way! You might be asking why don't we just release this on Oculus Quest store but the truth is it is much harder then other stores, since the level of game has to be really high for the game to get it published into the App store. And quite frankly we didn't even tried to publish it because we know our game is not there yet, but we will keep working hard on the game so we can reach the level so we can get it published! We won't be updating the version of the build that is available for download, but in the future we will definitely support cross-buy if we will qet to Quest App store. In future updates: Flashlight feature, Replay ability, Better interaction with monsters etc.. If you would guys like to support us. Go and buy our game in Oculus Rift, Go App store or here SteamVR will follow.. Join our Discord https://discord.com/widget?id=584852114057199621&theme=dark And you can also follow us on twitter or instagram https://twitter.com/paperbunker https://instagram.com/paperbunkergames Thank you for your support! ------ Dig and find freedom through old mine, while running away from bloodthirsty horde of monsters, which is chasing you. But be on lookout! You will have to take care of all 5 bombs prepared for destroying the mine. http://paperbunker.cz ------ 5.8.2019 Version 0.2: Because, Oculus made some changes in latest firmware.. Our version for the Quest wasn't playable. So, we fixed it.. Plus added fancy vibration when you have some jump scares :)
